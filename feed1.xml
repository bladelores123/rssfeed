Sit down and do the whole routine. This is not kindergraten. This is a serious spiritual discipline. So stop dicking around. You have to treat this seriously, like it's the most important thing in your life.

<p>
	The point is understanding how the human mind works. Changing Evangelicals is not the point.

<p>
	LOL

</p>

<p>
	Consciousness of the Holy Spirit is WAY beyond what most Blue religious people ever experience. Blue religion is purely ideological for the most part. It is a set of beliefs.

<p>
	I don't see evidence for that. The structure of their worldview and cognition is Blue, even if they start a business and earn some money.

<p>
	Orange is more secular than religious.

<p>
	Devil is a technical term in my body of work. You have to understand what it means. It is not a demonization. Ironic as that is.
</p>

<p>
	A devil is one who acts out of blind selfishness and refuses to admit it. A devil is one who rejects that he is God.

	I stand corrected in that Rumi did not found Sufism itself but he founded the Mevlevi order and the famous whirling dervishes meditation dance:

<p>
	It's a powerful kundalini activator for some people. The energy it activates can get stuck in various ways and lead to all sorts of spiritual emergencies. Not to mention that any kind of technique which rapidly builds up mindfulness and elevates consciousness can cause people to freak out. The ego-mind tends to resist such efforts in many different kinds of sneaky ways. It can trigger sleepless, anxiety, anger, restlessness, tension, cravings, visions, hallucinations, paranormal phenomena, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You should read up on the dangers of activating kundalini before you start yoga. I have some books on my book list about it. You don't want to be caught unawares.
</p>

<p>
	Basically all the stuff I talked about in my The Dark Side Of Meditation video, but even worse.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, it's not guaranteed that bad stuff will happen. It's just a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how deep you go with it. If it takes you all the way to enlightenment you can certainly expect all the freakiness that comes with awakening, including the Dark Night of The Soul. Awakening is not all rainbows and daffodils. Some egos have serious freak outs.
</p>

Again, you need to educate yourself on women's reproductive issues.
</p>

<p>
	Banning abortion is a terrible idea as you will create black markets and all sorts of health complications for a medical procedure which needed for many women. Not even to mention the human rights violations.
</p>

<p>
	Trump banning abortions is NOT a silver lining. It is a massive regressive step for society.

<p>
	Don't project your worldview and values onto others. Most people don't give a damn and would love to see the endangered species list nixed just to stick it to liberals. Or to be more accurate, most people are so clueless they have no idea any of this is even happening.

	There is enough devilry in the Catholic Church and the Evangelicals to occupy you for decades.

	Going vegan sounds good in theory, but in practice not enough people will do it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that massive systemic problems require solutions that SCALE across tens of millions of people. 10s of millions of people are not going vegan any time soon.
</p>

<p>
	Reform of the political system is necessary. The #1 step is removing all money from politics.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care, donate or volunteer to: Wolf-Pac.com to help them pass a Constitutional Amendment to get money out of politics. And vote in primaries for the most progressive leaders. Primary all centrist corporatist Democrats. There will not be change so long as corporatists are in power. This means corporatist Democrats and all Republicans. Kick them out.

	Environmental problems are chiefly systemic. They cannot be solved at the individual level, they must be solved at the collective level.
</p>

<p>
	You can recycle all the Coke cans you want, but it will not make a dent in the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Environmental problems require a stage Yellow systemic perspective. So your energy would be better used not in recycling Coke cans but getting politically active. Voting in your local primaries and donating to conscious politicians and telling your friend to vote too is more important than recycling Coke cans.
</p>

<p>
	To solve most of our serious problems all that's needed is serious political engagement. Elect the right people and they will solve the problems for you.
</p>

<title>Why Evangelicals Support Trump</title>

<p>
	This is a revealing look into the Evangelical mind:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqGd9fHz0jg?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Notice that stage Blue -- because it is very conformist -- is extremely easy to fool and manipulate by a stage Red/Orange opportunist like Trump. A stage Blue person has no problem buying the idea that Trump is "a man of God".
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how TYT (stage Green) struggles to understand stage Blue. It baffles TYT how stage Blue people can exist. They're constantly surprised by the foolishness of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	A classic example of the Blue vs Green understanding gap.
</p>

	It would be highly systemic in its thinking and it would be working to solve serious world problems, not building iPhone apps.
</p>

<p>
	Think of software that could help move other people up the Spiral somehow.
</p>

<p>
	And also your company would need to have stage Yellow leadership style and organizational style.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to do some serious research to build that. Don't expect such a job to fall in your lap. You have to invent it and lead it.

They are trying to unify a nation. They can't do that if everyone goes their own way. Blue is nationalism, which is what China's up to. They want to build a cohesive national Chinese identity. Of course this doesn't just happen willingly. People resist and China cracks down.
</p>

<p>
	Not saying China is the good guy here, but understand why they do what they do. They do it out of love.

</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be tricky for HK because China will not let them be independent as they used to be under British rule.

	Not-knowing does not exclude foul play.

<p>
	Of course it is very fishy and should be investigated. But I see people jumping way too eagerly towards conspiracy theories, which is a recipe for epistemic blunder.
</p>

<p>
	Best to admit "I don't know" and conduct an investigation. Of course an investigation is necessary. Pretty much everyone agrees on that.

<p>
	Because society has built up a bureaucratic infrastructure through 10,000 years of bloodshed, rape, genocide, theft, torture, and other horrors that you cannot even being to imagine.

<p>
	Thanks to that infrastructure (which we call government) you enjoy the life you do while being totally oblivious as to how all this works or where it came from.

	This is a good case to admit the truth: You don't know.

<p>
	The opposite of strategic voting is called foolish voting.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, don't be a fool. Values don't mean shit if they are not actualized. It helps no one to vote for people who cannot win.

<p>
	Yes, all this is normal and great stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual purification I call it. The body stores a lot of emotional baggage, fear, tension, ego, etc. You're gonna have to release all that shit to reach the highest levels of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The good news is, your next trip should take you much deeper into existential insight. The point of releasing personal baggage is to make yourself pure enough to realize the deepest existential insights.
</p>

<p>
	Next time try contemplating a question like: What is Love? What is God? Why does reality exist? What is intelligence? What is perception? What is consciousness? What is evil? and so forth.
</p>

<p>
	Once you purge all the energetic blocks, that's when the trips become really interesting. You can sit calmly and just contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	You must actively seek it, otherwise the whole world would be awake, and hardly anyone is.
</p>

<p>
	Some very spiritually advanced folks have spontaneous awakenings. But this is extremely rare for the most and not something you can rely on.

<p>
	That is a pretty absurd question. Of course the company must make profit off you, otherwise they'd be out of business.
</p>

<p>
	Business is not so simply. A company does not always know how much it's going to make off you because companies take risks. In some cases a company could actually lose money on you.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask that question on an interview, you will never get hired because it's way too combative and entitled, and doesn't appreciate the complexities of business.
</p>

<p>
	I've hired people before on whom I've lost money. And so have other companies.

<p>
	Through lots of trail and error I have found this to be true.
</p>

<p>
	It does not make sense to recommend self-inquiry to people who are stuck in monkey mind. They can spin their wheels for years without getting anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	Mindfulness training or Kriya Yoga is great for calming that monkey mind.

<p>
	Just be aware, taking medications to halt the spiritual purification process is like pressing the gas and the breaks in your car at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally you let the process unfold naturally without trying to escape from it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be very difficult at times. The more growth you try to accomplish is the least time, the more shocking it is to the system. So there's a trade-off here. You can spend a decade waking up or a week. If you do it in a week, it will probably be hell.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing to understand is that in the waking up process, serious emotional and energetic upheaval is quite common and normal. It is not a "bad" thing. Ideally you push through it. But if you feel like it's reaching a life-threatening level, then obviously find some way to back off and come back to it later.
</p>

<p>
	Also be ware of ego backlash. It's coming.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, you gotta understand that what JP is doing, he's doing out of love. A twisted version of love.
</p>

<p>
	But you should also keep in mind that what Trump is doing and what Hitler did was also done out of love.
</p>

<p>
	So just because someone is doing something out of love does not mean it will turn out well for you or even for himself.
</p>

<p>
	The one who suffers the most from JP's ideology is himself. He is clearly not a happy man.

<p>
	This is certainly true. Many young people today lack discipline and other healthy aspects of Blue.

Whether you like the church or not, it definitely contributed to taking people through stage blue.

To me it is likely that it is due to a lack of a strong and good stage blue foundation.

<p>
	Yes, and it also leads to demonization of all higher stages. There is a cottage industry on YT for demonizing Green. Folks make careers out of it. One such folk is JP.

</p>

<p>
	I find the questioning to be ineffective without first being in a calm mind state.

<p>
	No, I'm not implying anything per se. I'm just assessing Trump's mind. He has the type of mind that will take down the ship with it if it goes down.
</p>

<p>
	I don't foresee a nuclear holocaust. But some phony war is within the realm of possibility.
</p>

<p>
	And more importantly he is going to wage a battle domestically this coming election cycle. It's gonna get nastier and dirtier than ever as his chances of reelection shrink. He will rally and whip up his base into an ideological frenzy. There will be even more conspiracy theories, demonization of decent people, and probably some degree of violence as things get desperate for Trump's base and they start to lash out.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand about Trump's base is that they're all-in. They will never admit defeat or any wrong-doing -- because it will be too ugly for them to admit. So they will double-down and scapegoat someone else -- like immigrants, Muslims, socialists, women, or whoever. As the failures of the Trump admin keep getting worse, the scapegoating will keep getting worse.
</p>

<p>
	The Trump phenomenon is like a giant swollen pimple that needs to burst. How bad it gets is hard to say. We have to be careful, but also don't get overly pessimistic. This is all part of the nation's growth process. It is all necessary to evolve to the next level. Just be careful not to get caught up in the eruption.
</p>

			I have serious panic disorder based on hypochondria and the fear of death. My plan for ultimately getting off them is firstly in depth psychoanalysis and simultaneously doing consciousness work, meditation, self inquiry and yoga in order to ultimately reach enlightenment, go through the experience of being absolute infinity, realize I'm not the same as this body so I don't have to obsess over defending its existence.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit: My pursuit of enlightenment though is different, it starts from curiosity more than a need to heal. Honestly ssri's are doing a wonderful job at the moment with zero to little side effects and I am back to an almost fully functional state, so in a sense they solve the problem. I could go on SSRI's and never have another panic attack. I want to pursuit the truth, being healed from my trauma is for me something a little more secondary.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So what this tells me is you got A LOT of work to do before anything like enlightenment will dawn. Probably years of work.
</p>

<p>
	That's okay, but what I mean is, you don't have to worry too much about enlightenment right now. Focus building up your meditation skills, psychoanalysis, yoga, etc. All of that will build up your foundation. At some point you should begin to slowly ween yourself off the medication and pursue the Truth full-bore.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is about facing your own death. So you need to build yourself up to the point where you're not having panic attacks and you a ready to face ego dissolution. You are not going to be able to avoid facing death. That is the whole aim of enlightenment work. Enlightenment is all about facing your deepest fears and seeing through them with extraordinary levels of consciousness and concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Weening yourself off SSRI's will also allow you to play around with psychedelics -- which are one of the most effective tools for facing death and fear.

<title>Meditation Question - Thoughts vs Insight</title>

What are you trying to understand or get?
</p>

<p>
	Sits are usually not nearly as effective without a clear intention. It's very important to become clear about what you want out of this work. And there are many things you could be working on / developing / realizing.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to just sit and done nothing, without any objective or goal. Fine. But then make that your intention and be clear about it: "I will just sit here like a cat and be in the present moment."
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes that's effective.
</p>

<p>
	Other times it's more effective to have some existential question you're working on, like "What am I?" or "What is reality?" or "What is Love?" or "What is Truth?", etc.
</p>

<p>
	But understand this: there is way more to this work than merely sitting like a cat. Nothing wrong with sitting like a cat. But if you really want to understand reality, life, and self -- that won't be enough. You need to probe various aspects of life to crack its secrets.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could be working on building concentration skill.
</p>

<title>Amazing Scaramucci Realization</title>

<p>
	I was amazed by this interview because in it Scaramucci (a stage Blue/Orange Wall Street guy) finally realizes Trump's stage Red nature. And finally he turns on Trump.
</p>

<p>
	The key moment happens right at the 0:30 mark. He realizes that Trump is not evolved enough to be genuinely racist because he's too much of a stage Red opportunist.
</p>

<p>
	It's the most amazing back-handed compliment I've ever heard, LOL:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqAhFqah2Pw?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	A great lesson in psychology and Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	It's also very revealing that Scaramucci saw Trump's opportunism in the flesh, but it never bothered him until now. Which is exactly right. Stage Orange itself tends to be opportunistic without much remorse or foresight of the problems that such unchecked opportunism leads to.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem with putting a shameless opportunist into office is that he won't hesitate to start a war if it helps him get reelected. The more cornered such a person becomes, the more dangerous he becomes because his only concern is his own survival.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump goes down, he will take the entire ship with him.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What are the unhealthy aspects of Green?
</p>

<p>
	Sit down by yourself and list all of them out. Then compare to Green news sources like TYT. You will see a nice match if you do the exercise properly.
</p>

<p>
	But you're gonna have to step outside your own personal opinions and biases to do this exercise correctly.

<p>
	That only holds true for Green IF the other side is tolerant and non-oppressive.
</p>

<p>
	Green does not tolerate oppressive versions of stage Blue or Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Green will often viciously demonize capitalism or Wall Street, for example. Green can even be violent against oppression, as in the case of eco-terrorism, PETA, GreenPeace, and Antifa.

<p>
	No. That is incorrect. You need to study the Spiral Dynamics theory more. Go read the SD book or the works of Ken Wilber.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber wrote an entire book about the "Mean Green Meme". Green precisely demonizes Orange and lower stages.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you misunderstand Green.
</p>

<p>
	Green is precisely tribalistic against oppressors. Green does not embrace those who are intolerant, like racists or authoritarians. Which is why Green dislikes Trump so much. They cannot stomach his bullying of people and his divisiveness.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a collectivist stage which comes with some group-think and dogmas. This doesn't make it Blue. Green dogma is quite different from Blue dogma. Overall, Green is much better at dealing with multiculturalism. Green is not nationalist or racist. Blue is.
</p>

<p>
	Green is not so evolved that it will be understanding of racism. That requires Yellow and above.

<p>
	Actually, that's part of Green. Green sees Blue & Orange as evil sometimes.
</p>

<p>
	To stop seeing Blue & Orange as evil requires Tier 2 Yellow perspective, which of course Green lacks.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, Trump supporters are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Have you watched some videos of Trump rallies? Of Trump supporters being interviewed? It's beyond deplorable:

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not enough to resonate with Blue or Orange. One has to transcend them.
</p>

<p>
	I can make YT videos that resonate with stage Blue and feed their worst racist impulses, leading them towards Nazism.
</p>

<p>
	I can make YT videos that resonate with stage Orange Wall Street types and help them to further exploit society and 3rd world countries with sweatshops.
</p>

<p>
	Fearmongering (as JP like to do) is not an effective way to lead people up the Spiral. How can you elevate stag Blue & Orange people to the next stage -- Green -- when you fearmonger about feminists, post-modernists, relativism, LGBTQ, environmentalists, hippies, Marxists, socialists, and communists??? That sends a message to stage Blue & Orange: "Don't bother going Green. Green is delusional and dangerous. Stay Blue & Orange."
</p>

<p>
	Conscious leaderships requires pointing out the limitations and dysfunctions <u>of the current stage</u>, not the future stage. For JP to lead people out of Blue & Orange he would have to be talking about the limitations and problems of Blue & Orange. Instead he talks about the limits of Green. Talking about the limits of Green is only helpful if you and your audience is at least Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP denies the seriousness of climate change. That alone tells you the danger of his ideology.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13282-zizzero/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13282" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13282-zizzero/" rel="">@Zizzero</a> Many of these sources certainly have a bias.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that Tier 2 political sources basically don't exist. We live in the real world, where stage Green politics and news is about as advanced as it gets (for now).
</p>

<p>
	TYT is leading an effort to get money out of politics. Show me one other source which is doing that? Show me one right-wing commentator or channel which is vocally advocating for removing all money from politics or passing a Constitutional Amendment to remove money from politics.
</p>

<p>
	Like I told you before, both sides are not equal.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be able to watch these sources while at the same time being aware of their their biases (and your biases).
</p>

<p>
	And you always have to consider: what's the alternative? You gonna watch CNN? Fox News? What? You gonna stick your head in the sand and do nothing? All those alternatives are worse.
</p>

<p>
	Despite whatever biases they have, TYT is serving a very important function in promoting uncorrupted democrats who take no corporate PAC money or big dollar donors. Nothing like that exists anywhere else right now. If you can't appreciate the value of that, that's your bias clouding your vision.
</p>

<p>
	TYT elected one of the most conscious, empathetic, and uncorrupted congresswomen ever: AOC.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is actually the cutting edge of politics in America.
</p>

<p>
	Any threads which aren't up to par will simply be moved to the Sefl-Actualization or Spirituality sub-forums.
</p>

<p>
	That should work well.
</p>

<p>
	Once we get a lot of threads, we might elect a dedicated Mod to curate that sub-forum and make it pretty with good formatting. If anyone is interested in that job, get in touch with me. A track record of mature forum behavior is required.

<p>
	I've had this idea for a long time of leveraging the collective creative effort of this forum.
</p>

<p>
	I feel that a lot of our creative potential is lost here in talking and debating. A much better use of our time would be to work collectively to create the world's greatest database of self-actualization & spirituality resources. As you guys study self-actualization and spirituality you will naturally stumble upon life-changing resources which often go forgotten and unshared.
</p>

<p>
	I have been wanting to find a way to channel your guys' expertise and creativity towards some higher purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Now we have a new sub-forum dedicate to this purpose. It will be a heavily moderated sub-forum. Please read the Guidelines there before posting. It's important that we maintain a high quality threshold on this sub-forum.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/32-high-consciousness-resources/" rel="">https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/32-high-consciousness-resources/</a>
</p>

<p>
	I look forward to seeing some great contributions.
</p>

<p>
	Let me know what you think about this idea.
</p>

<title>High Consciousness Resources Guidelines</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/32-high-consciousness-resources/">High Consciousness Resources</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This sub-forum is meant to be unlike other sub-forums. Only start a thread here if you have a high quality conscious resource to share. The resource could be a link, a video, a website, a podcast, an interview, a TED talk, etc. But it must be some external resource link. Do not just start a thread here about some opinion you have. Your link must also be relatively high quality and related to consciousness work / inner work / self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	The vision for this sub-forum is that over time we will build an amazing list of the highest consciousness videos, interviews, podcasts, teachings, and links on the web. Think of this like a collectively curated list of the best of the best teachings. A newbie who browses this sub-forum should consistently strike gold.
</p>

<p>
	This is community-created resource list which gives our members a chance to make a positive, long-lasting contribution to the forum rather than just debate or talk. Think of this like a Self-Actualization & Spirituality Wikipedia.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		All threads in this sub-forum will be heavily curated by Mods to make sure they truly belong here.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discussions of the linked resource are allowed and welcomed inside the relevant thread.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not start a thread in this sub-forum unless you have some external resource to link.
	</li>
	<li>
		Try to keep politics out of this sub-forum. We have a dedicated Politics sub-forum for political resources.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not link Actualized.org videos here. That is redundant.
	</li>
	<li>
		This is not a place for self-promotion.
	</li>
	<li>
		Give your post a good descriptive title, so people know what they're clicking on.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It's important that we maintain a high quality threshold for content in this sub-forum in the same way that Wikipedia does.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some ideas for threads to get your mind jogging:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The Best Of.... XXXXXX (replace XXXXX with any quality spiritual teacher: Osho, Ekhart, Spira, Mooji, etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Resources For Addiction Recovery
	</li>
	<li>
		Resources For Kriya Yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Science & Spirituality Intersects
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Muslim/Sufi Spiritual Resources
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Christian Spiritual Resources
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Schools Of Yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Hatha Yoga Online Programs
	</li>
	<li>
		List Of Top Meditation Teachers
	</li>
	<li>
		List Of Top Spiritual Retreat Centers
	</li>
	<li>
		Conscious Sexuality Resources
	</li>
	<li>
		Best TED Talks Relevant To Spirituality
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Psychology Lectures
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Philosophy Lectures
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Environmentalism Podcasts
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Marketing Courses
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Resources For Starting Your Own Business
	</li>
	<li>
		Motivational Talks
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Resources For Building A Powerful Morning Routine
	</li>
	<li>
		Top YT Fitness Channels
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Online Indian Gurus
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	As you can see, there's enormous potential here.
</p>

<title>Quality Political Analysis Resources Mega-Thread</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38189-quality-political-analysis-resources-mega-thread/?do=findComment&amp;comment=478985</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Post here links to YT channels, podcasts, & websites which offer high quality political analysis.
</p>

<p>
	High quality political analysis is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Systemic, complex, nuanced
	</li>
	<li>
		Holistic
	</li>
	<li>
		Questions the status quo, calls out corruption, speaks truth to power
	</li>
	<li>
		Non-blaming, non-demonizing, non-conspiratorial
	</li>
	<li>
		Grounded in facts & evidence
	</li>
	<li>
		Grounded in historical understanding
	</li>
	<li>
		Grounded in solid non-partisan journalism
	</li>
	<li>
		Attempts to be fair to the other side, avoids strawmanning the other side
	</li>
	<li>
		Non-dogmatic, open-minded, willing to change its mind on issues
	</li>
	<li>
		Not overly focused on culture war issues
	</li>
	<li>
		Shows empathy for all humans and living beings, regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Advocates for non-violence as much as possible
	</li>
	<li>
		Doesn't fear-monger
	</li>
	<li>
		Doesn't scapegoat gays, non-whites, communists, globalists, Jews, feminists, academics, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Appreciates cultural diversity and different POVs
	</li>
	<li>
		In-depth rather than merely sound bites
	</li>
	<li>
		Cares about environmental issues
	</li>
	<li>
		Appreciates the importance of balance
	</li>
	<li>
		Understands the dangers of false equivalency and "neutrality"
	</li>
	<li>
		Interested in unearthing root causes of problems
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Yes! These can be tough subjective calls to make. Self-bias is always a distorting factor.
</p>

<title>Conscious Politics Guidelines</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38162-conscious-politics-guidelines/?do=findComment&amp;comment=478968</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This sub-forum is for discussing all aspects of Conscious Politics. This includes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Governments across the world
	</li>
	<li>
		Analysis of important current events
	</li>
	<li>
		Environmental concerns
	</li>
	<li>
		Culture Wars
	</li>
	<li>
		Collective issues which affect all of society
	</li>
	<li>
		Systemic social problems, inequality, injustice, oppression, wage slavery, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ideas for how to improve society & government
	</li>
	<li>
		Discussing elections, candidates, political analysis
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Please keep in mind that this is a naturally controversial topic. Watch your self-bias, ideology, and devilry extra closely as you think about and talk about these issues. These issues are emotionally charged precisely because they go to the core of your identity & survival. Don't turn this sub-forum into a distraction from inner work.
</p>

<p>
	This sub-forum will be heavily moderated for devilry and toxic forms of ideology. The following are not allowed:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Conspiracy theories
	</li>
	<li>
		Racism, nationalism, fascism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia
	</li>
	<li>
		Spreading propaganda videos. Sources like Fox News, PragerU, etc. will be considered propaganda. (You can link them if you are debunking them.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Threats of violence, inciting violent uprising
	</li>
	<li>
		Arguing that some races or ethnicities are biologically or fundamentally inferior to others (by citing IQ differences, etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Posting violently graphic videos (terrorist attack videos, etc.)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This sub-forum is meant to be a nuanced (Spiral Dynamics Tier 2) discussion of politics, not a culture war. Discuss political issues from a systemic level.
</p>

<p>
	Be here with an open mind. Be here to learn. If you are just here spreading your pet ideology you will probably end up banned. Make your arguments without resorting to personal insults, name-calling, or strawmanning. Be nuanced and understanding of the complexities of social issues. Things are rarely black & white in this domain. Usually every POV has some degree of partial truth so it's a matter of carefully sorting through the nuances.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the issue isn't Left vs Right, the issue is low vs high consciousness, low vs high development, fear vs love, selfishness vs selflessness, dogma vs objectivity, ignorance vs education.
</p>

<title>Warning: Recruiting To Chat Not Allowed</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38160-warning-recruiting-to-chat-not-allowed/?do=findComment&amp;comment=478952</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Using this forum to recruit members to private chat groups like Discord, Skype, WhatsApp, etc. is against Forum Guidelines.
</p>

<p>
	Such groups splinter the community and can easily turn toxic as the activity happens in the shadows without moderation or oversight. Such groups can become very cult-like.
</p>

<p>
	If you are caught creating or participating in such things your account will probably end up insta-banned.
</p>

<p>
	Please keep in mind, Administrators have the ability to monitor your Private Messages. Moderators do not have such an ability. I try not stick my nose into PMs, but I do occasionally scan them for devilish activity. This is unfortunately a necessity as people will occasionally abuse the PM system in serious ways.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is to keep our discussions of Self-Actualization centered here, out in the public. Otherwise the community fractures into factions.
</p>

<p>
	If someone contacts you to join a private group, please report such people to me.
</p>

<title>can't fall asleep after 5meo bad trip, it's been 4 days please help</title>

<p>
	Sounds to me like the 5-MeO opened you up and now you're going through a classic "spiritual emergency" as Stan Grof calls it.
</p>

<p>
	This is a normal part of the waking up process. Of course it can feel hairy when you're in the thick of it.
</p>

<p>
	You might want to read up on Stan Grof's work on "spiritual emergencies".  Most people don't get them, but plenty do as they get deeper into this work.
</p>

<p>
	I would try to frame this as a positive. Clearly you were very sensitive and that trip unlocked something in you. The process is just happening so fast that you feel overwhelmed. Try to roll with it and become curious about what is happening to you, rather than trying to stop it or trying to go back to your old life.
</p>

<p>
	The resistance and worry is largely what causes the suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, this work involves undergoing significant change. Have faith in the process. This should help you calm down and roll with the punches.
</p>

<p>
	The 5-MeO is long out of your system. This is simply you starting to wake up. The ego mind can resist the process in all sorts of creative and dysfunctional ways.
</p>

<p>
	Truthority has been banned from this forum.
</p>

<p>
	It is obvious he will keep creating distractions if he was allowed to stay.
</p>

<p>
	I swear, after managing this place for 3 years, it's getting too easy to spot the troublemakers before they even get warmed up. So I am less oepn to giving them second chances these days.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like banning people, but it comes with the territory.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I've noticed a good clue that some new member is likely a devil: his username will contain a word such a Truth, Enlightenment, Consciousness, Infinity, or some noble phase like "The Awakened One" or "I Love Truth". It's a classic sign of a devil to co-opt such terms. If the username sounds too noble, be very suspicious.

	There are just far too many higher quality sources you could be learning from.

Truthful insights can be hard for the ego to accept. If you're doing psychedelics the one thing you can know for sure is that they will reveal things about you & reality which you will find disturbing and uncomfortable.

<p>
	Can you delude yourself? Always! Delusion has been your way of life since your imaginary birth.
