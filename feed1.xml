	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Eternal is just the realization that time is a concept. Eternal means: outside of time. As Einstein correctly explained, time does not really exist. Time is a relative measure of motion and distance. If the entire universe stood still, it would be impossible to tell what time it is. We can only measure time through motion.
</p>

<p>
	Every moment is in fact eternal. Since past and future are just imagination, they do not actually exist.
</p>

<p>
	When you look at a clock, realize, it is not actually measuring anything. It is merely a spinning object.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, all measurement is imaginary. It's a story we made up. Measurement tells you absolutely nothing about reality. It's just a relative ratio of two arbitrary things.
</p>

<p>
	You can become conscious of why everything appears to exist and why it functions as it does.
</p>

<p>
	A full consciousness of God is the answer to all existential why questions. It's a very very very satisfying answer. The answer is non-verbal. Your understanding becomes TOTAL. No more questions about life remain. Everything is perfectly clear. You become literally omniscient, but this omniscience is non-verbal. You could never verbalize it.

<p>
	I mentioned many countries and places in the example lists in my Spiral Dynamics mini-series.
</p>

<p>
	1st world countries are mostly Orange and above.
</p>

<p>
	3rd world countries are mostly Blue and below.
</p>

<p>
	Northern Europe is Greenest.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of the Middle East and Africa is Purple/Red.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of South America is Red/Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Major cities are usually 1 or 2 levels higher than nearby rural areas.
</p>

I tend to go overboard with variety of technique. At some point you'll want to pick a thing and drive it home.
</p>

<p>
	If I was forced to pick one thing, it would be Kriya yoga. Because it has a strong physiological component, which I think it important, especially if you have lots of monkey mind.

It depends a lot on you. You need to find a technique you're happy with and then hit it hard.
</p>

<p>
	There is a trade-off between dabbling vs getting stuck.
</p>

<p>
	The more techniques you try, the more risk of dabbling. The less techniques you try, the more risk of getting stuck. I've met people who meditated for 20 years but still weren't enlightened. They got stuck.

<p>
	Some good questions. Yeah, if you guys want to post your questions here, I might pick some for part 2. Part 2 hasn't been shot yet.
</p>

<p>
	Make your questions good. Make them about God itself, not meditation technique or other aspects of spiritual practice.
</p>

			Or maybe just having one experience is all you need because you only need to align yourself once?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice, one experience of God is almost never enough. One experience of God will likely leave you more confused than zero experience of God. God is just too big to grasp it all at once. You'd probably faint if that happened.
</p>

<p>
	It took me maybe 10-15 separate breakthrough experiences to get a solid understanding of it.
</p>

<p>
	But eventually your goal is to make it a permanent state of consciousness, called Sahaja Samadhi, where you are conscious of God 24/7. This is called the stateless state.

<p>
	If you physically kill yourself, all that will happen is you will change forms into something else. But you will still be here: nowhere, nowhen, nothing, now.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape yourself. Ever.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: you've already killed yourself a million times. Which brought you to this life you're in right now.

	Getting 5's, 6's, and 7's is pretty straight forward. But if you want to date 8's and 9's, you gotta bring some serious value to the table. Hotness comes with a price. Hotness ain't free. As far as 10's, forget about it. Not even worth thinking about.
</p>

<p>
	Handling 9's and 10's is not gonna be worth your time most likely. They can be really high maintenance and have spoiled rotten materialistic souls.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to land 9's and 10's is to become famous. So your social value is obvious and glaring it's never in question that you are the prize and she's be lucky to be in your presence. Fame is an awesome dating strategy and can tie in nicely with your LP. For example, if you're a famous author, you should have no problem getting laid from social events and book signings.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful not to abuse it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There's nothing to explain. "Stuff" will arise and pass away. Various mystical states will happen many times in various ways. Spiritual phenomena will come and go. Be careful not to project too much meaning into it. Take it at face value as phenomena.

<title>Strategies for helping stage blue people evolve into orange?</title>

<p>
	A way that should work is success-oriented self-help. Nothing spiritual or nondual or New Agey or metaphysical. Just pure techniques for being more successful at everyday life. Secular advice, like a book about how to earn more money or a book on how to be more charismatic. Perhaps a book on history, biography, or popular science. That kind of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	A person who's in high Blue should show an interest in the above.

<title>Journaling App Advice?</title>

<p>
	That's a big investment to make with significant risk of failure.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend that you first thoroughly research your market to make sure that what you're gonna be selling will actually sell. You must research all such similar apps and see how your app could compete. You need to have a solid, realistic plan for how you're gonna make that money back.
</p>

<p>
	Hiring a developer is pretty easy. Sites like Guru.com and Upwork.com allow you to hire developers from around the world at affordable rates.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest mistake new entrepreneurs make is that they fail to properly test their idea before launching it, only to hear the sound of crickets as no one even knows your product exists. You must have a realistic marketing strategy. How are people going to find your app? A good product alone is not enough.
</p>

<p>
	Developing the app itself is the easiest part of your plan. Marketing the app is the hard part. How much will you charge and who's gonna buy it? Will it really be useful to people? Will it be unique enough to get word-of-mouth recommendations? How are you gonna get your first 100 sales? Who is your target audience? What needs do they have which aren't already being served? How will your app compete against other apps like OneNote and EverNote? As an entrepreneur it's your job to solve all those questions.
</p>

<p>
	If you're gonna be in the app-making business, you need to carefully study the app marketplace. Which apps sell? Which apps flop? Which parts of the market are saturated? Which parts of the market aren't? How much money can you expect to make? How are successful apps marketed? etc.
</p>

	It's hard to quantify it like that. I don't measure my investigations into topics in hours. But I've probably spent 50-100 hours studying Spiral Dynamics. That's probably what it takes to have a solid grasp of it.

<p>
	Kriya yoga
</p>

<p>
	Also you might want to consider EEG brain training / neurofeedback therapy. It can be very effective for ADHD. Find a local provider.
</p>

<p>
	Search Yelp for something like this near you: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/sierra-eeg-neurofeedback-therapy-grass-valley" rel="external nofollow">https://www.yelp.com/biz/sierra-eeg-neurofeedback-therapy-grass-valley</a>
</p>

<p>
	Binaural beats can also be helpful to jump start your meditation.

			Do girls care so much if you are having a lot of meaningless sex, to be attracted to you?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	They don't care how much sex you have, nor will they ever know.
</p>

<p>
	But what they do care about is that you have some value as a man. To a woman, value in a man is his survival value to her. A valuable man usually acts confident, witty, easy-going, leader in his pack of friends, outgoing, charismatic, takes initiative, knows what he wants, passionate about his life, has a clear sense of direction in life, has a decent job, a results-maker, the boss, etc. The girl needs to feel that YOU are the prize. If you feel that she is the prize, she's basically out of your league and she knows it and so she won't get attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	Guys who are surrounded by lots of friends, who are the hub of their social network, have high value to a girl. She will find such a guy much more attractive than a loner because girls are social creatures and love to leech off social networks. That's a big part of their survival strategy.
</p>

<p>
	To get the hottest girls you need to build a lot of social value. It's a full-time job. Having lots of friends who are girls are a great way to get girls interested in you. That's like the epitome of social proof. The more hot girls are around, the more will flock to you. Just like earning money. Winner takes all, loser ends up getting scraps.
</p>

<p>
	Being famous is the best way to have social value. Which is why rockstars, DJ's, and celebrities get laid the most. Girls love a guy who has some solid social status which everyone recognizes.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, you don't need any social value to get a girl. It's mostly only necessary if you want to land the hottest girls, the top 5%. Ordinary girls will settle for much less. To attract an ordinary girl all you need is some confidence, humor, and decent conversation skills. All of which can be trained up.
</p>

She's not really attracted to you. Sounds like you did something to lose her attraction, or you never had it to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Are you actually having sex with her? Or is this some kind of Platonic relationship?

	What you don't realize yet is that BEING is superior to meaning. Stop needing meaning. Enjoy being.

<p>
	You need to become conscious that you are assigning negative meaning to meaninglessness.

<p>
	You are not conscious of this yet.

	Take responsibility over the fact that you create meaning. And create whatever you want.

It's a very big field with lots of potential solutions that you'll never hear from your doctor. Some of it can be life-saving stuff. Alternative medicine books have been written on virtually every ailment known to man. Just do a quick Amazon or Google search.
</p>

<p>
	Like so:
</p>

<p>
	"alternative treatments for MS"
</p>

<p>
	"natural healing MS book"
</p>

<p>
	Replace "MS" with whatever ailment you have.

<p>
	Of course we should be open to the possibility that what the OP is describing is not kundalini but something else. Perhaps some kind of disease or other kind of dysfunction. The human mind/body is a very complex machine which can become broken in thousands of subtle ways. Diagnosing all these ways is not trivial, sometimes taking years of investigation and trail and error.
</p>

<p>
	Chronic health conditions can be a real nuisance. I've been dealing with several of my own, and it's not easy.

Any ideas you have of me being a good or bad person or whatever... it's ALL your own stuff!
</p>

<p>
	Makes you wonder... Have you ever related to an actual human being in your entire life? Or was it always your own self you were relating to? Projecting your own ideas and needs onto them? Investigate that.
</p>

<p>
	Any meaning your attribute to me or my work is your own projection, serving your ego in some way. In truth, my work is literally meaningness.

No one said to avoid anything. You are arguing against your own self.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you associating psychedelics with some kind of avoidance??
</p>

<p>
	You might as well go to a Zen temple and complain to them that meditation is a form of avoidance.
</p>

<p>
	As a general rule of thumb: You are creating whatever results you are getting.

<title>Is Ego backlash the root cause of depression?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31138-is-ego-backlash-the-root-cause-of-depression/?do=findComment&amp;comment=363730</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Not ego-backlash but <u>ego</u> is the root cause of depression.
</p>

<p>
	More accurately, the ego-mind is constantly evaluating, judging, and assigning meaning to reality. Depression is one of these meanings which you are creating but you are not conscious that you are creating it. It happen automatically in you because your level of consciousness is quite low.
</p>

<p>
	Try this experiment: sit comfortably at home and do not think a single thought about the future or the past. Be fully present. Strip all meaning from reality. Can you still feel depressed?
</p>

<p>
	Keep doing this until you realize that depression is something YOU ARE DOING! It is not happening to you! All negative emotions are something you create. Negativity is never found in the "external world". It arises out of how your ego-mind assigns meaning to external things based on its survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	You might say, "But Leo, what if I get cancer? Cancer caused me to be depressed!" No! The meaning YOU ASSIGN to cancer causes you to be depressed. And it possible to train yourself to stop assigning meaning to things.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness and mindfulness helps with depression. But you must actually do it. And the catch-22 is, if you're depressed, you probably don't want to do it, nor do you want to believe what I'm saying.
</p>

<title>Advice on approaching Women</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/826-emerald/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="826" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/826-emerald/" rel="">@Emerald</a> What you're missing is that attraction is not a rational choice.
</p>

<p>
	See, you're evaluating this whole situation theoretically, which is not at all how it works in real life. In real life, if a well-dressed, nice-looking guy with a big smile, confidence, and swagger stopped you while you were walking down the street and told you he found you attractive and had a fun conversation with you, all of your logic would fly out the window. It doesn't matter if he's "using a pickup line" on 100 other girls. A good approach is a good approach. The line is irrelevant. The words never matter. It's all in the tone and body language. You would be flattered, your self-esteem would be boosted, and maybe you'd get attracted to him. Attraction is never a guarantee. Often the chemistry just doesn't happen. But attraction is not something you logically decide upon. It happens near-instantly based on deep subconscious cues. Attraction happens within 5 minutes. Within 5 minutes the girl determines and demonstrates whether she's willing to sleep with the guy. The rest is just comfort-building. But she is not conscious of any of this. It all happens automatically.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not factoring into your theory is that that guy could actually attract you! If you're being fake polite, etc. that means he hasn't succeeded in attracting you. You've succeeding in rejecting him. His job was to bust through your automatic knee-jerk defense mechanism. He must do that through charm, confidence, and humor, not through meeting any logical criteria you have. Obviously if you're already married with a kid, you are much less open to approaches. But consider if you were single. (BTW, if the guy knows what he's doing, he'll check your finger for a wedding ring before even approaching you).
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is a very counter-intuitive thing. Be careful underestimating it or logically analyzing it. There is zero logic in attraction. It does not happen based on any rational standards that you may think you have. Which is precisely why girls easily get attracted to scrubs who abuse them, and yet the girl only gets more attracted!
</p>

<p>
	And even if an approach is a nuisance, this cannot be avoided because the guy has to approach the girl because the girl will almost never approach the guy. Yes, the girl incurs the cost of a creepy approach. On the other hand, the girl is freed of the hell that is approaching. You girls have no idea what it takes to make a natural approach or to be rejected dozen times in a row. You should be thankful you don't have to do it.
</p>

<p>
	It is the guy's job to approach and the girl's job to screen him for quality. That is how human mating works. Not unlike the courtship rituals of birds.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the cost of being a hot girl is that you will get approach a lot. That's both a blessing and curse. And you're not going to change that. Guys are wired to approach you. And you're wired to screen them.
</p>

<p>
	The thing with approaching is that it's not supposed to work 95% of the time. 5% is all it takes for love to happen <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> It is just like sales. And sales works precisely because people buy.

<p>
	Ultimately there is no such thing as the subconscious mind. That is a conceptual abstraction. What is real is present in your direct experience right now, and at all times.
</p>

<p>
	But more practically-speaking, yes, you can basically become conscious of anything that is "running" you. But that is WAY beyond enlightenment and will take you decades of serious work. Very very very few spiritual masters have done this. Emotional self-mastery is much harder than enlightenment.

<p>
	I never said it was a useless tool. I said it has a major downside in my mind due to its addiction potential and dulling stoning effects. It's too easily overused, becoming a chronic thing people do. It becomes recreational all to easily.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see the point in it when there are better options available like LSD, mushrooms, or 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Edible pot is probably better than smoked pot for spiritual growth purposes. Although I'm not experienced with pot. It never appealed to me.
</p>

<p>
	The trio of mushrooms, LSD, and 5-MeO-DMT will transform your entire life forever if used properly.

Yes, there are many degrees of wokeness and many degrees of embodiment and mastery. Yes, there is much left to master and become conscious of even after a deep awakening. "Full enlightenment" is virtually a fantasy and no method promises it. To become fully conscious of your entire emotional system and subconscious mind is a very tall order to fill. But even here, I think psychedelics can be helpful as you can use them to become more conscious of all aspects of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Of course psychedelics will not do all the work for you if you're shooting for "full enlightenment". You'll need to spend THOUSANDS of hours in contemplation and self-study to achieve that.
</p>

<p>
	If psychedelics cause you to get lost in ego, that's something you're doing. It doesn't have to be that way.
</p>

<p>
	I use psychedelics quite sparingly. For every 1 trip I do hundreds of hours of meditation, integration, contemplation, and study. So there is no problem.
</p>

<p>
	If you're just tripping balls every week and doing no other spiritual work, yeah, that could become problematic.

Not the right ones, in the right ways, with the right intentions.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are very nuanced things. There is an art and a science to taking them which requires careful attention to master.
</p>

<p>
	A few trips is not anywhere near enough to figure psychedelics out. If you haven't taken 30+ trips in the proper ways, you won't really understand psychedelics. Psychedelics must also be combined with existential inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind that people have different brain types and personality types. Maybe psychedelics are not so effective for you, but for others like me, they are undeniably effective. So be careful not to over-universalize your personal limited experiences. It is a fact that psychedelics transform peoples lives. Just maybe not yours.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, I'm willing to bet you've never done a breakthrough 5-MeO-DMT trip.
</p>

<title>Difficult Kundalini symptoms</title>

I would recommend you find a yogi who's experienced in kundalini awakening and tell him your story. He should have some good advice for you.
</p>

<p>
	I also recommend you read some good books about kundalini awakening. There are exercises and practices for dealing with blockages and for venting the excess energy. I am no expert on kundalini, but from what I understand you need to get the energy out of your system with physical practices. You're not supposed to bottle it up. It has to work through and out of your system. Exercises that might help you: dancing, speaking in tongues, screaming, shaking your body, Osho's dynamic meditation, physical exercise, jumping, Hatha yoga, hitting a punching bag, etc. I would look for physical ways to vent that energy which feel best for you.
</p>

<p>
	If what you're describing really is kundalini activation, Western doctors are not going to help you, as they're clueless about it. In fact, they will probably give you harmful solutions. So go find a yogi.
</p>

<p>
	Content alone is never enough.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're not succeeding is because you're trying to enter markets which are already heavily saturated. Business requires that you find new fertile ground. There are only so many YT spiritual teachers that the world needs. I was successful on YT not because of my content but because I was on there early, before it blew up, and I had significant marketing skills.
</p>

<p>
	My content is NOT what makes me successful or popular. Business success has almost nothing to do with content. It's about marketing strategy.
</p>

<p>
	You need to take some marketing courses.
</p>

<p>
	Your approach might have worked 10 years ago, but not today in those fields. Blogging is almost impossible to enter these days. Even when I started Actualized.org, blogging was basically dead to new entrants. You need to be more original than that.
</p>

<p>
	In business, a new field is only open for so long. After that, it closes. You cannot start a new Facebook today, or a new Google, or a new Microsoft, or a new car company. Those markets are saturated and monopolized already. You must find new markets.

<p>
	"Listen, I'm flattered you like me, but I'm just not interested."
</p>

<p>
	Don't go into justifications. You don't need to justify anything. Just tell him you are not interested. That's enough.
</p>

<p>
	As a side note: you being 26 and never dating is a sign of dysfunction. Don't wait to make yourself perfect before you date. Part of the reason you may be depressed is that you're too closed off from people. Dating will make you grow a lot, so consider doing it. Not necessarily with this guy, but some other guy you like.

Stopping a woman randomly in the daytime with a genuine direct approach makes her day. It makes her feel great.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how you'd feel if a hot girl approached you at the supermarket and told you that she's attracted to you. You'd feel awesome even if you never took her up on the offer. You'd feel like king for the day.
</p>

<p>
	Go to a mall, stop any random woman and tell her that you just thought she was beautiful, and she will be so happy. Obviously don't lie about it, it must be genuine.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You've also clearly never gamed.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't say that was the end of the conversation, I said that's the opener. From there you use cheeky conversation to build attraction.
</p>

<p>
	Stopping a woman cold on the street and being genuine with her about your feelings about her is extremely rare. It builds instant attraction and it makes you stand out from everyone else. I am not talking about a pickup line, I am talking about genuinely expressing yourself. This also makes her day. She will feel great the rest of the day even if she declines your offer for a date/coffee/phone number.
</p>

<p>
	The words you say to a woman almost never matter. What matters is how you carry yourself and the tone you take. Most attractive women will have boyfriends, but you'll never know until you try.
</p>

<p>
	Every street approach ends with an invitation to an instant coffee date, and failing that, a phone number.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest issue here is that you don't have the balls or skill to pull off such a direct and genuine approach, nor the skills to carry the conversation, nor the skill to close it.
</p>

<p>
	If you find a woman attractive, hiding your feelings about it to try to weasel your way into her pants is weak. She will smell your manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	Hot women like men who are clear and decisive about what they want. When a woman makes you feel something, you don't hide, you be direct about it, the way a strong man would. That in itself builds massive attraction.
</p>

<p>
	Women only hate being approached when you are being creepy, insecure, or obnoxiously cat-calling her.
</p>

<p>
	Stay away from ketamine as it can be both physically harmful and addictive.
</p>

<p>
	There are much better options.
</p>

<p>
	I do not like the idea of you guys getting into ketamine.

<p>
	For me integration doesn't require an active process. It's more passive. I just passively re-live the experience in my mind many times and contemplate it. My mind sorta just naturally goes over it again and again until it makes sense. The best way to enable this is simply to give yourself free time to contemplate. For example, I love driving late at night and just organically contemplating stuff. Not as a technique, but just doing it "naturally", for enjoyment, not to get a certain outcome.
</p>

<p>
	For me the obstacle to integration is being too busy with mundane chores or business or social obligations. So try to minimize those.
</p>

<p>
	That is already known about Octavio. He's worked with something like 5000+ people. Yeah, out of 5000+ people you will have one or two terrible cases, especially when smoking it outdoors.
</p>

<p>
	A normal person is never gonna die from plugging 20-30mg of 5-MeO-DMT at home.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO raises heart rate for newbies. So if you have a bad heart condition, then it might be a problem. Although that raised heart rate is really only an ego reaction to facing ego-death. For example, if I take 5-MeO now my heart rate can stay pretty calm because I am used to the ego-death experience. It happens very gracefully now.
</p>

<p>
	I think forcing newbies to smoke 5-MeO (as Octavio does) is bad practice. Smoking is far too harsh for many newbies to handle. I can see that some of them might totally freak out. The best method for newbies is plugging synthetic. I would only suggest smoking to advanced psychonauts who already had a 5-MeO breakthrough.
</p>

Especially if you're smoking it. I did a lot of integration through LSD and mushrooms after 5-MeO.

<p>
	You can't compare these directly to each other. This notion of "awareness" is a very loaded notion, changing depending on context.
</p>

<p>
	You could say awareness is there all the time.
</p>

<p>
	You could say awareness doesn't exist at all.
</p>

<p>
	Both are true simultaneously. You have to know what is being pointed it.
</p>

<p>
	Also, my newer video: What Is Consciousness? is a more accurate explanation than the video of mine you linked above.

<p>
	After a 5-MeO breakthrough, most other psychedelics become very 5-MeO-like. So watch out. Lower your dosages.
</p>

<p>
	Allow some time to pass so you can integrate. I took me months, and probably over a year, to fully integrate my biggest 5-MeO breakthrough. And I've had numerous other breakthroughs afterwards which also took some weeks/months to integrate and make sense of.

The top locations are: nightclub, bar, daytime cafe, busy sidewalk, mall, crowded restaurant area, college campus, etc. The bigger the city you live in, the better the locations will be. Small city locations suck.
</p>

<p>
	Then it's just a matter of seeing ones you like and doing a direct genuine approach with a light-hearted, positive vibe. My favorite opener is: "Hey, I just saw you walking by and I found you attractive so I decided to come meet you. So here I am."

<p>
	It's fairly natural that if you follow me, like my work, and shell out $250 for my course that you will be similar to me in many ways. At the same time, you will be different from me and your LP will not at all be expressed in the way I express my LP.
</p>

<p>
	Just look within and make sure you are staying true to yourself, not just aping me. If you are being true to yourself and it happens to look like what I'm doing, that's not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Also make sure that you are partaking of other sources beside myself. The problem with relying too much on one source is that your mind isn't given enough variety of input to produce a truly original output.
</p>

<p>
	Copycatting is a problem of lack of diversity of input. For example, an aspiring film director who's in love with George Lucas films so much that he only watches George Lucas films is doing himself a great disservice and will end up a copycat.
</p>

<p>
	Creative people need to vastly diversity their inputs, otherwise their output will be unoriginal. That's one of the reasons that I literally study 100s of obscure sources. I have no interest in being a cookie-cutter Tony Robbins clone.
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to be creative outside the box. There are so many different ways to express a common set of values or even the same career choice: like being a life coach. You can be a totally unique life coach if you do it right.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Stop trying to know things beforehand. You are putting the cart before the horse.
</p>

<p>
	Either do, or do not.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be asking, "I've heard of roller-coasters, is going on a roller-coaster a good thing? What if it goes off the rails?"
</p>

<p>
	"I've heard of microscopes, is looking into a microscope a good thing? What if a bacterium pokes my eye out?"
</p>

<p>
	"I've heard of music. Should I listen to it? What if it gives me ear cancer?"

<p>
	If you're serious about spirituality, read the top rated spirituality books from my book list.
</p>

<p>
	That's all you need. And then PRACTICE!
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with this idea of "studying" spirituality. Spirituality is not meant to be studied, it's meant to be lived. The ego-mind loves to study stuff without actually changing itself.

Don't stop now! You don't necessarily have to settle this question immediately. You might want to give yourself some space to explore your top 2 or 3 possibilities with some small bets (see video about Small Bets) and see which one you like more. You could also potentially find a way to integrate several things together, like becoming a consultant or artistic director, which would allow you to have your hand in multiple cookie jars.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, though, it sounds like you're overlooking the obvious: music. Your heart is telling you MUSIC! but your mind is scared to actually do it. By definition making a decision means cuts off certain possibilities. By choosing music you are saying No to other things. And that's how it should be. That's what creates a clear sense of purpose. Otherwise you're unfocused.
</p>

<p>
	Re-watch the videos in the course about FEAR. Fear is one of the biggest obstacles here.

			I'm having trouble reconciling this. I want to let go, surrender, and listen to the part of me that wants to align with passion and service. Is it not ok to <strong>want</strong> to make the world a better place? I just want to make sure that this is not still the Devil in disguise. How do I trust that my life decisions are correct when the devil has made me fail so many times?

<p>
	Don't get ahead of your skiis here.
</p>

<p>
	For practical purposes, yes, you CAN rely on your intuition and follow your genuine passions and your heart. We might call this the "higher self" or "the soul". This is still not the full True Self, but it's good enough to bootstrap your life.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is okay to want to make the world a better place, just don't go overboard. Don't turn it into a mad crusade. And don't neglect your inner work, the Greater Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be useful to explore your subconscious mind and to integrate various fragmented parts of your psyche. It's not the ultimate solution, but it's a decent starting point.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that this work has many parts. Not everything is about awaking up. There are also more practical aspects to life and even to your mind and psychology which need to be worked on. For example, maybe you have some childhood trauma that needs to be ironed out. This not going to enlighten you, nor will it end all your suffering, but it's still important to do because all of that psychological baggage adds up and constricts your ability to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There is no escape from the devil. The forces of devilry are always at work. So you must always stay vigilant and study the devil's ways. But at the same time, don't get paranoid. Generally speaking, follow your heart. Sometimes the devil will trick you even when you try to follow your heart. That's okay, you will get better and better at avoiding his tricks.
</p>

<p>
	And with some deep enlightenments, the devil's grip over you will significantly diminish. Not totally, but significantly.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: The Paradox Of Developing Self-Trust

	He wasn't talking about awake people. He was talking about inwardly-oriented people.
</p>

<p>
	Research shows that about half of heroin addicts and alcoholics are people in search of awakening, but not knowing that what they seek is God, they find a pseudo-God in the heroin or alcohol.
</p>

<p>
	So what Tolle is saying is that.

<title>Difference between Contemplation and &quot;armchair&quot; philosophy</title>

</p>

<p>
	Observation leads to new insights. These insights can be both verbal and non-verbal. It's okay to start with verbal ones. That is valuable still.
</p>

<p>
	As you deeply examine and question fear, new distinctions will form. For example, you could notice that fear has a significant mental/conceptual component, as all emotions do. Emotions are NOT just perceptions or sensations. Emotions are conceptual constructions. For example, fear is only possible when your mind is thinking of the future. No future, no fear. No mental imagery, no fear. If you observed fear closely, you'd notice that, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you assume that you already know what fear is. You assume that what you see after 5 mins of observation is in fact what is there. That is NOT the case! Your mind is not allowing you to see what's really there because of all the conceptual filtering and cultural knowledge which is clouding your perceptions.
</p>

<p>
	As a rule of thumb: nothing you see with your eyes or feel with your body is to be trusted as a raw given. It's all heavily interpreted and conceptually distorted.
</p>

<p>
	For example, look at your hand. It is not a hand, as you assume.
</p>

<p>
	When examining fear it is useful to ask additional questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is the purpose of fear?
	</li>
	<li>
		What are the components of fear?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is mecessary for fear to exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		How and why do I create fear?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Be careful not to anticipate what the answers to these questions will be. You must actually do the observation and see what happens. The answers will often surprise you.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe one day you'll discover that fear is an illusion <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are not even conscious most of the time that you are afraid. And you experience fear MANY times per day.
</p>

<p>
	As for not frying your brain, sure, I agree. Psychedelics must be done responsibly.

<p>
	And as for Martin not being as awake as some others masters you're comparing him to, no one said he was.

I use breathe strips to help widen the nasal passages. You could also experiment with various decongestants like FloNase or Xclear. Or at least blow out your nose before you start.
</p>

<p>
	Just practice sucking in air slower. As slow as possible.
</p>

<p>
	I just timed myself. One in-breath takes me 22 seconds.

<p>
	That's not extreme for a person who's awakening.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above are typical and to be expected if you're getting serious about spirituality. In fact, that's sort of the point of doing spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	That kind of stuff is not unique to psychedelics. You can get that from yoga, meditation retreats, self-inquiry, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want results or not?
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is a radical process.

<p>
	Kriya is not for dabblers. It needs to be taught in a proper way, not one video.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is a lazy thing. You've been way too spoiled by my videos.
</p>

<p>
	I might teach a Kriya course in the future, but not for a while, as it needs to be done in the proper way.

So in that sense, would the teen years be a sort of "peak" of open mindedness for people within culture, where they're just old enough to know a lot about the world but not too old to have fully conformed? I think that's what I'm getting at here.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I wouldn't say that. You're generalizing way too much here. There is enormous diversity between different teens. You can't speak of teens as one object.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking teens are less developed than adults in all categories.
</p>

<p>
	Teens are quite stupid, reckless, and immature. There are some rare exceptions, but even they are still very under-developed. That's just the nature of being human. A human being does not become mature until basically age 25-30. Which is why rental car companies do not rent cars to people under 25.
</p>

<p>
	I would not trust anyone under 30 years of age to be mature. It's really that bad.
</p>

<p>
	And these days kids are getting stupider. They are being indoctrinated by digital media from age 5. So don't think you're safe.
</p>

<title>Empathy: Green seeking to understand Blue</title>

<p>
	So what's your question?
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue charity is not very inclusive and often just a trick of the ego-mind to make itself feel righteous and moral.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Green empathy is more powerful, although still not completely selfless.
</p>

<p>
	What you're really talking about is Love. Your capacity to love will increase the higher you go up the Spiral, the more developed and conscious you are.
</p>

<p>
	True Love is not really possible without awakening, which is beyond the Spiral entirely.
</p>

<p>
	The obstacle to Love is self.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The True Self wants nothing. That's the paradox. By wanting nothing you get everything, and by wanting stuff you are forever trapped in a cycle of fragmentation and self-created hell.
</p>

<p>
	But also, within every devil there is a tiny 1% part which wants to return to God. That is what allows for the devil's salvation.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't a fragment, you couldn't exist. See? In order to stay alive you MUST fragment yourself. If you stopped fragmentation you'd be dead! The way you've set up life is, you've defined fragmentation as "life" and unity as "death". So you're busy all the time avoiding unity. You are terrified of unity because it would mean the loss of the fragment you call you.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is just a fragment of God!

<p>
	Teens are hardly emotionally developed. The only thing they've got going for them is that they haven't yet been full brainwashed by culture. But that happens very rapidly by the end of the teenage years. As a teenager most of your concerns have to do with fitting into culture and being a good little conformist sheep. So your brainwashing is almost complete. You basically brainwash yourself to avoid feeling like a weird outsider.

	Knowing is possible, but it is never the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be known, it must be not-known or Be-ed.
</p>

<p>
	It is the in fact the case that you do not know what anything is. You've only managed to convince yourself that you know. For example, you do not know what a chair actually is. The situation is so bad that you don't even know what you are. What you have a false identifications and images, none of which is what those things actually are. A chair is not your image of a chair, and you are not your image of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	All of your so-called knowledge is just images, not the actual thing itself. Take a look.
</p>

<p>
	All knowledge is relative, never Absolute.
