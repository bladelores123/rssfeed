			this is where we disagree. the movement already has an unstoppable momentum. "serious" scientists won't be able to do anything about it. human culture will transform faster as more people are falling in existential crisis. it's a natural flow. of course you can scream and say "my scream is part of the natural flow". but you can also work quietly and peacefully and say "my calmness is part of the flow". up to existence!

</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm just saying a deconstruction is necessary along the veins of what Thomas Kuhn's or Paul Feyerbend's work did in the 20th century for science. More of that is needed. It does not have to be screaming rant. Deconstruction can be calm. Or not. Both can be useful.

<title>Why would Leo Buy his new white t-shirt from a sweatshop?</title>

<p>
	I was just giving a hypothetical example. Don't take it so seriously. I have no idea where my shirt was made.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe it was made in heaven, by God himself?
</p>

<p>
	And maybe that looks no different than a Bangladesh sweatshop <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	No! You're not getting it. THIS IS THE PERFECT DESIGN! There is nothing perfecter.
</p>

<p>
	Any design you imagine would be worse than God's design. Seriously! Think about how profound what I am saying is. I'm not making this shit up. It REALLY is that case that this is Absolute Perfection. The imperfections are in your way of looking at it.
</p>

<p>
	It's as though you are looking at a massive flawless diamond through dirty glasses. So you keep seeing imperfections and blaming the diamond. What you need to do is open yourself up the possibility that the imperfections are an illusion created by your ego-mind. If you do that, if you clean your lenses, you will see that the diamond was always flawless. And your heart will melt.
</p>

<p>
	Wash yourself of yourself if you wish to see the highest truths. There is no other way. The lens of the microscope must be clean to get accurate results.

Dean Radin would be dismissed and rejected by most scientists. They would call him a kook, not a scientist. His paranormal research is rejected across the board by serious scientists. Not because he is wrong but because they are dogmatic materialists.
</p>

<p>
	People hold science in way too high a regard. So I think some bashing is a nice counter to that. A culture war is needed here to some degree. Right now people take science way too much on faith. It's part of the Orange stage.
</p>

<p>
	What's really needed is a full, methodical deconstruction of science, which I am in the process of writing.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you are more conscious than the typical scientist because you did consciousness work. Very, very few scientists are as wise as Einstein or Tesla. You picked two of the best of all time. That's unfair. I am talking more about your run of the mill scientists. Those who poo-poo metaphysical inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Science advances and evolves precisely through the critiques which I am verbalizing. This is true scientific method happening right here, right now in this thread! We are pointing out it's limitations so that it can become more pure. But as always, scientists hate it when you point out the impurities of science. They go into defense mode. It's an ego thing. They are committed to the survival of science, which ironically entrenches the impurities. Such is how all corruption works. The whistleblower gets demonized. I am the whistleblower. So scientists will demonize me.
</p>

<p>
	See, science is a collective ego. That's a profound insight. Go check out my Collective Ego episode and connect the dots. Science is not yet conscious enough to realize that it is a collective ego and all the ramifications this has. So we must make science aware of this to evolve it to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	Any time I capitalize a word I am talking about an Absolute. Good vs good. Good with a capital G is an Absolute. Absolute means it has no opposite. Yes, you can think of good vs evil, but then there is Good which has no opposite (which means it is ALL). When you are conscious of the Absolute Good, you realize evil has never existed. Only Good exists.
</p>

<p>
	Good for whom? Good for the totality of existence. Good for you as God. May not be good for the ego.

	Every creation is that way. Have you looked at how living creatures evolve? They are all hodge-podges of past creatures. No creature is ever created out of thin air in one step. Nor is any vehicle or human gadget or invention. They all require gradual refinement and evolutionary innovation. And yet, each creature still have original parts.

</p>

<p>
	I doubt LSD will do it. But who knows. Maybe a very high dose will. I've never experienced anything like that. What's far more profound is to realize that you are ALL lives simultaneously. You are not limited to some chain of past lives at all. You are Hitler right now. There is nothing which you are not.

<p>
	The only thing you will ever discover through consciousness work is more and more of yourself. Period.

	There is no "other". Only YOU! Wake up!

<p>
	Sounds in the right ballpark. I don't remember all the details of his theory. But Tom Campbell is not fully awake. His theory states that time is fundamental, which is false. He also says that reality is finite, which is false. He does not have a good understanding of infinity. He's still thinking of reality too much in physicist terms.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, his work is full of valuable and practical insights. It's just not the highest teaching or truth. Which is okay, but Absolute Infinity blows all that out of the water.

<title>Will Science ever prove Non-Duality?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Materialism is the belief in an external physical world which exists independent of the human mind. And it's the belief that this belief is not a belief but reality. It is the belief that consciousness is made out of material objects like neurons or brains. It is also the belief that the universe is dumb and inanimate.
</p>

<p>
	Models of reality are not the problem. The problem is that groundless metaphysical assumptions are rampant throughout science but at the same time materialist science poo-poos metaphysics, as if metaphysics is bullshit, but without any awareness that science is full of implicit materialist metaphysics for which there never was any scientific evidence.
</p>

<p>
	Another big problem is that scientists are NOT aware that their models are just abstractions. Serious scientists like Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll literally believe that the universe is mathematics or literally a quantum field equation. It's so ridiculous it's tragic.
</p>

			This point I didn't understand because it doesn't make sense to me that God would be absolutely unlimited but also that he has to respect some design constraint like there has to be some 'bad' stuff that would be good in the bigger picture because they are necessary
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What you are are overlooking is that creation IS constraint, IS limitation. God has not constraints, he can create whatever he wants, but once he's created it, that thing must be a certain way. God cannot create a chicken and then have it bark like a dog. To be a chicken means: can't bark like a dog. The vocal cords of a chicken cannot bark. This is not a limit on God's power. He made it that way! He doesn't want chickens to bark. They got other stuff to do.
</p>

<p>
	The design constraints are not placed upon God. God places the design constraints in the process of creation so that creation works harmonious with itself. If God created animals without suffering, those animals would not live long enough to breed. So he could do that, just like you could punch yourself in the nuts, but he's not stupid enough to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Stop assuming that suffering must be eliminated from the design, as if it's a parasite. Suffering is not some extraneous thing, it's there by design FOR YOUR GOOD! By seeking to eradicate suffering from the world you are fucking with God's design and unwittingly turning his heaven into hell.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering isn't a bug, it's a feature.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I tried it once. Didn't like it. It was too much for doing work. And that was 10ug.
</p>

<p>
	I suppose I should try it some more. I wanted it to be a powerful technique but for me it feels like I'm better off just doing a solid trip than microdosing. Other people may feel differently, like if you're depressed or something, maybe it would be good for you.
</p>

<p>
	Modafinil feels a lot better for everyday activities and work than 10ug of LSD. Modafinil is so nice I often don't take it simply because I feel like it's cheating. Life is too good on Modafinil, LOL. You can't rely on drugs to hold up your life. Tripping is different. Tripping is a rare event which is more like a rite of passage or a retreat. So it's very different from daily dosing of drugs for life enhancement. I'm generally not a fan of near-daily dosing of anything because it becomes a crutch.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, if you can't function without it because you have bad ADHD or whatever, then it might be good for you, for a while.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually though your goal should be to be totally free of chemical crutches. Happiness must come from within.

			I hope I understand what you're saying here Leo but I struggle with this a lot. People close to me are like "what's you're opinion on this?" when my opinion is generally "there's two sides to every story, everyone feels just as justified in their own argument as the person with the counter argument. Let them have their opinion and try not to let it affect you". 
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know what's true or false because there's two sides to every story and to weed out what's ego driven or emotionally driven is hard to separate from something that's been ingrained from culture. To find what's authentic vs. inauthentic has opened my eyes, once you find what your authentic opinion or view is then it doesn't matter what others say.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I read this I was scouring the internet for a book on discovering your authentic self. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is there any suggestions from anyone or if there's one on the book list, what category is this under?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What I am talking about goes much deeper than that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not just talking about figuring out your opinions on issues, like whether you should vote for liberals or conservatives.
</p>

<p>
	What you'll discover is that virtually no cultural programming you have is authentic. It's just random stuff your mind picked up. To become authentic you need to really turn inward and disconnect from culture and people. Doing solo retreats you start to see what authentic is.
</p>

<p>
	Not even your identification with being a biological organism is authentic.
</p>

<p>
	When you get super-authentic you will look in the mirror not even view that body as being who you truly are.
</p>

<p>
	To become authentic you must peel back layer after layer after layer of false identities which you have constructed throughout your life. There are many layers to peel back. Peeling them back is challenging because your physical, emotional, and social survival depends on them. Without them you would be lost. Which needs to happen in order for you to really find yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, start wherever you can. Most of you will have to start by peeling back the psychological and social layers. Look at all the mask your wear around other people. Look at all the manipulating and lying you do. Then there will be the existential layers.
</p>

Dark Night of the Soul is to be expected once you get deep enough into awakening work. It happens as the mind realizes that all meanings are self-constructed and that meaning is not absolute. Realizing this can feel depressing.
</p>

<p>
	2) To overcome boredom, become creative. Create something that gives you joy. That's what art is for. Come up with a life purpose and you will rarely be bored.

</p>

<p>
	There's a lot to say about them.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, a weak self will struggle a lot to be honest, integrous, and authentic because it is too fearful. It basically can't because it is not conscious of its own true nature. Ego is a house of cards cemented with lies.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, you can push your comfort zone and be more honest. This alone will grow you. But yeah, to get a massive gain in this domain you must have some awakenings to your true nature and Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	How can you be authentic and honest when you don't know what is true and what is false, what is authentic and what is inauthentic?
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are wonderful for this topic. They will make you honest by beating you into submission.

<p>
	Wait and see. There's too much to say.
</p>

<p>
	If I say, "Trump is President of the United States" is that true or false? How do you know? What makes it true? What does it even mean to say it is true? If you don't know what truth is (and you don't), how can you even say that something is true or false? What are you even saying with those words. What does it mean to say God is true? Is truth a concept or something else? If it's not a concept what is it? If it is a concept then are non-conceptual things not true? How many kinds of truth are there? One, two, three, infinity? Are colors true? Are words true? Is perception true? Can ideas be true? Are false things true or false? Do false things exist or not? Is there something in between true and false? Does truth come in degrees or it is binary? Etc, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take the most basic things for granted.
</p>

<p>
	You could spend the next 20 years of your life studying what truth is and isn't and how truth works. And you would probably be wrong.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Try Kriya yoga or counting the breath to build up your concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry is an advanced practice which should only be done once you've calmed your mind down and are able to maintain some degree of concentration. Otherwise it just won't be effective.
</p>

<p>
	In Zen they start newbies off with counting of the breath. It's actually quite smart to do so. Count each exhale from 1 up to 10, then repeat from 1. If you lose track, start over from 1.
</p>

<p>
	Do this until your mind calms down and stops thinking about random stuff. Then you can turn towards self-inquiry more.
</p>

<p>
	It might also be helpful for you to do self-inquiry using a journal. Question whatever you identify with and try to deconstruct it on paper. This process is very good for opening you up to not-knowing. At first this questioning will be conceptual. That's okay. You have a lot of conceptual baggage to deconstruct before you can just sit and focus on the I AMNESS. For example, are your memories you? Is your DNA you? Is your brain you? Are your sensations you? All of this must be questioned and deconstructed even just conceptually.
</p>

<p>
	Sitting and focusing on the I AMNESS is a very advanced practice. It is really not for newbies. A newbie monkey mind cannot get traction with it. It's too busy, too active.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The topic of truth is not just enlightenment. I mean other aspects of truth.
</p>

<p>
	I won't be rehashing the same old stuff on this topic. The fact is 99% of people are deeply confused about what the word "truth" even means.
</p>

<p>
	What is truth? That's a profound question and the answer is not something like God or The Self. There's more nuance to it than that.
</p>

<p>
	My truth video will be very eye-opening for you even if you've watched all my enlightenment stuff. In fact the topic is so deep it requires multiple videos.
</p>

<p>
	That is not quite right because a human being DOES have some agency/will which Mario does not.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the ego's will that is in control, it's God's will. Luckily you are God. So God's will is really your will, not something outside you. Humans have a small sliver of God's will in everyday life, which the ego co-opts as its own.

</p>

<p>
	Selflessness and honesty go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
	The conflict is between honesty and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you lie is due to fear and selfishness. You do not lie out of selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	If you were truly selfless you would never need to lie.

<p>
	Suffering is absolutely vital to life. There cannot be living creatures without suffering. Pain and suffering is what keeps a living creature alive long enough to breed.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful thinking you can design reality better than God. You can't. So stay humble and learn to understand why reality must be structured exactly as it is and not according to your fantasies of how it should be.
</p>

<p>
	God's design is good. Your design would be shit.

	Keep doing research into your issue and you'll discover even more solutions. Tons of solutions exist to discover for any life problem.
</p>

<p>
	For example, for ADHD, heavy metal urine testing is critical. You need to make sure your organs are not full of mercury, lead, etc. Those seriously distrupt normal cognitive function and will make your life really difficult.

<title>Total Liberation vs No-Mind vs Samadhi?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33087-total-liberation-vs-no-mind-vs-samadhi/?do=findComment&amp;comment=393446</link>

<p>
	It's complicated.
</p>

<p>
	They are all distinct achievements.
</p>

<p>
	Sahaja samadhi would be abiding God-consciousness as I understand. Other lesser samadhis are temporary. They are not abiding. So in that sense they are like a psychedelic peak. Psychedelic puts you into samadhi automatically. Then from that state you can have profound insights and realizations.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation to me means totally overcoming the self. Breaking free of all identification and all attachment to the material world, such that you are not driven by cravings or suffering. At this point you would be close to just leaving your body because you are so detached from life. You are basically giving up human life to be formless because you've had enough of form. You are no longer interested in exploring form. You just desire to be the Godhead. Liberation should bring you very close to something like that.
</p>

<p>
	No-mind is yet a distinct achievement. Although of course there tends to be overlap between all these. They are all pointing in the same general direction.
</p>

<p>
	I would not worry about these nuances for now. Just focus on having a few solid awakening experiences. You'll figure out the rest afterwards. Don't get ahead of your skiis.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Human growth is spiral because you circle back around to where you had previous been, but you are now higher, thus a spiral path is traversed.

<p>
	Absolutely!
</p>

<p>
	Set the intention to be more loving in all situations. That will yield huge growth.
</p>

<p>
	Stopping judgment is so critical if you are serious about the spiritual path. All judgment is delusion, including the judgment that people should stop judging.
</p>

<p>
	Judgment is a direct obstacle to Truth, Wisdom, and Love.

They are good examples of integrating science, philosophy, & spiritual intuition.
</p>

<p>
	The sad irony is that our top scientists used to be visionary geniuses, philosophers, and mystics. And now we have a bunch of materialist hacks in lab coats thinking they are advanced.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophy is badly in need of a renaissance.

	Dude, allow some leeway for people to go through a process of discovery and growth.
</p>

<p>
	You're being a flippant harpy.
</p>

<p>
	More compassion, less harping.
</p>

<p>
	I do not confuse mystical experience with Truth/Infinity/Love/Consciousness. Do not confuse 5-MeO-DMT for mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not something you let go of. Love is the consequence of having fully let go.

			I don't think Peter Ralston feels enlightened at all. 
		</p>

		<p>
			His book "The book of not knowing" is a pain in the ass to read, it just feels like mental masturbation, mind games. While for example "The Upanishads", "Ashtavakra Gita" and "Bhagavad Gita" is a joy to read, can't stop reading those kind of books.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also interesting that Peter competed in martial arts, maybe that is an indication of a massive ego? And I can sense that massive ego when I see him talking in videos.
		</p>

		<p>
			Competing in martial arts is like the exact opposite of what is taught in Advaita Vedanta, Hinduism and those things. Both selfish desire (competition) and violence is included in martial arts. Next step would be to be in the military and shoot people.
		</p>

		<p>
			But of course, I <strong>could</strong> be wrong. I'm not that closed minded.

<p>
	The word intelligence is confusing to people. Most people think of intelligence as IQ or human mind stuff. That is not the Absolute Intelligence I talk about.
</p>

<p>
	No, I would not equate intelligence with awakening. The wiser you are, the more likely you are to see the need to awaken. Let's put it that way.
</p>

<p>
	God's Intelligence is infinite, but to you this falls on deaf ears. You must awaken to this fact.

<p>
	This is where 5-MeO-DMT (or other psychedelics) can be so useful. They will help you cultivate a desire for God, Love, Truth, and Consciousness -- which will then make you really serious about this work. And then you will get massive gainz!

	I call that the dialectical nature of life. That's what Hegel called it. Reality bounces back and forth between opposites. War leads to peace. Peace leads to war. Sadness leads to happiness. Happiness leads to sadness. And so it goes on and on in every area. Stock market rises. Stock market falls. etc.

My heart told me I must pioneer the 5-MeO-DMT path.
</p>

<p>
	But I am not opposed to shaktipat.

	I think yoga goes all the way up to the highest nondual stage. Depends on which yoga and how you do it.

I think awakening must be not only in the head but the whole body. Energetic blockages must be released. Otherwise you might awaken but your embodiment of it will be lacking.

He laughed and said that yogis are not really enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever that means.
</p>

<p>
	The bliss you can definitely experience on psychedelics. Very strong doses of 5-MeO-DMT also activate kundalini although I'm not sure if it's being activated safely. On my highest dose ever of 5-MeO-DMT, the consciousness was so powerful that it was too much to handle and I felt kundalini shoot out of my fingertips like force lightening, resulting in skin damage to my fingertips. It was a very freaky experience bordering on the paranormal. I don't think it was healthy. But damn was it powerful. I have never had kundalini activation on 5-MeO-DMT except that one time. That was a very large dose which I would not want to take again. To be any more conscious you'd be so conscious you'd physically pass out.

Neither of those two ever talk about losing identification, God, Kundalini, etc. unless I am unaware. All their teaching stops at "I-I". Which really is just a step before self-realization. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Ralston is a sneaky one. He's very tight-lipped and coy. He deliberately does not mention God, but he's fully aware he is God. He just won't talk about it because (I assume) he's worried it will get the ego-mind churning with religious fantasies. Kundalini he does not talk about. Not sure why. I think he might consider it a distraction, a relative experience. Losing identification is his whole teaching. He clearly has zero identification with anything. You have to really study his work closely to understand his depth. He might be one the most enlightened human beings on the planet. But his teachings are very advanced. He does not over-explain things for newbs like I do AT ALL. You have to really struggle through his teachings to understand their depth. The only way to appreciate Ralston is to study with him face to face. It's quite an experience. He is deeper than a Zen master. He teaches some very advanced things but they all sound so simple you can easily miss it and he don't give a fuck if you do. It's like an advanced graduate college class where the professor just expects you to do all the work. He doesn't even bother to give you homework or tests or explain much.
</p>

<p>
	Seems to me that Rupert Spira also teaches about losing identification, he just might not use that language.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with evaluating teachers is that they might not use the language you use. So you have to give them some leeway. Some teachers develop their own systems which do not use the categories and verbiage of classical traditions like Vedanta or yoga or Buddhism.
</p>

<p>
	Seems to me that it's possible to awaken without having a kundalini awakening experience, thus people who awaken without much kundalini surges might not emphasize it in their teachings. Teachers tend to emphasize their own path to awakening. But there is more than one path because not all human minds/brains/bodies/personalities are the same. Imagine for example what it would be like for an autistic male to awaken versus a super emotional psychic female. They will have VERY different paths even though the ultimate realization of Truth will be similar after the dust settles. There are a lot of psychic people who have very weird and twisted paths to awakening. It's going to be very hard to understand or evaluate them unless you have had those kinds of extra-sensory abilities for your entire life. It's like being a different species of human. Their brains work differently.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine what awakening might have been like for a neanderthal. It is said they may have had bigger brains than humans. Their awakenings would have been different than human awakenings. But of course this does not negate that the Absolute is still the Absolute. People underestimate how much neurology plays a part in the awakening process. This becomes obvious if you do a lot of various psychedelics. You experiences impossible states of consciousness which are totally outside the catalogue of the traditional spiritual literature. Because consciousness can basically be any which way imaginable and there are just things which you will never be able to meditate or self-inquire your way to. Something like saliva you are not going to get through meditation. There are also various kinds of brain-damaged states and brain pathologies which lead to interesting new kinds of consciousness which virtually nobody knows about or understands because all that's really mapped out are the mainstream norms. Not the very weird edge-cases. Imagine what it would be like to awaken as a psychopath or schizophrenic.

<p>
	For example, are you able to look at an object like a pen and be conscious that it is infinitely deep?

</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of how you create your own body?
</p>

<p>
	What is your consciousness of causation? Are you able to be conscious that every object, like a pen, has an infinite chain of causation leading to its current state?
</p>

<p>
	Just curious which facets you've experienced and how they line up with stuff I've experienced.

<p>
	What I'm saying aligns with the best spiritual traditions. Almost all of them talk about degrees of awakening. So it's not an ego thing. I don't really care about being more awakened than someone else. I just care about not missing some important insight which I might easily overlook if I wasn't careful and comprehensive. I would rather err on the side of comprehensiveness. Because I can't anticipate everything I don't know. I always leave room in my epistemology for surprises and big reversals. All that's really required is radical openmindedness. Don't close down your mind even after an awakening. Keep being curious. Keep learning. Keep reading. Keep hearing other points of view. You just never know what you might discover.

But that end sits at the bottom of a very deep well, so very few people have reached it. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Of course minor insights about life have no end. Those and science are infinite. There is an infinite amount of personal development -style insights.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation does not require learning about everything. Learning never ends, but liberation I think has some end-point. You could be liberated but still learning new stuff every day about the world. It's important to distinguish those.
</p>

<p>
	If you define liberation as totally knowledge of everything, then that seems impossible.

</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about it. Learn from whoever you feel is good enough for you. Learn from multiple sources to avoid blindspots. Have at least 10 different sources that you are cross-referencing or you will get blindspots.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I cross-reference 50-100 sources to make sure I don't get trapped in a blindspot. That's how seriously I take this epistemic problem. It is no joke. You will get trapped, I can almost guarantee it.

<title>How deluded Leo is ?</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/6963-legendary/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="6963" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/6963-legendary/" rel="">@legendary</a> That is very difficult to assess in practice, especially if you haven't had multiple awakenings yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The challenge is that different minds talk about awakening in different ways, so just because two people talk different and emphasize different things does not necessarily mean their level of awakening is different.
</p>

<p>
	To be totally honest, I don't know anyone else's level of awakening. I only know what levels I have experienced. The rest is my speculations.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to try to guess a person's levels of awakening by asking them various questions about the nature of reality. Depending on how they answer these questions you might catch some clues about how awake they really are. But again, you're still just guessing. You don't really know. It could just be a failure to communicate. Many awake people are just poor communicators.
</p>

<p>
	Some questions I like to ask people to determine how awake they are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Why is there something rather than nothing?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		How does God create?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is your true nature?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is non-existence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Infinity?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Love?
	</li>
	<li>
		Have you become conscious of infinite intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the deepest thing you've become conscious of?
	</li>
	<li>
		Do other people exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If they are not able to answer these questions clearly and satisfactorily, then I consider that they are not fully awake. Although it might just be that they don't want to answer such questions. It can be hard to tell.
</p>

<p>
	To me the highest teaching must affirm: 1) You are God, 2) Total nonduality, 3) Infinity & Nothingness
</p>

<p>
	Teachings which cannot answer the question of why there is something rather than nothing are incomplete in my opinion. Because I have clearly answered this question for myself. So I know it can be done. Teachings which try to emphasize emptiness or formlessness over form are also incomplete in my opinion since they fail to fully comprehend that form and formlessness are identical. Teachings which claim there is no God are also suspect. Since you can clearly recognize that you are God. I am also suspicious of teachings which never talk about absolute Love or which deny Love as an Absolute. I am also suspicious of teachings which do not ever mention the energetic aspects of awakening. I am super suspicious of any teachings which claims that enlightenment is binary and has no degrees. To me this is clearly false as my experience says otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	If someone cannot explain clearly what God is, why God is, and how God works, they are not fully awake in my opinion. Since I have been able to understand all that for myself. It can clearly be done. And not as theory, belief, or speculation. You can be totally conscious of how God works.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can also evaluate a person's demeanor, energy, and vibe. But this can also be misleading. It can be hard to tell whether you are projecting your own ideas onto them.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice the best thing you can do is not to get married to any one teacher or teaching. Keep looking for deeper and deeper teachings and you will probably keep finding them. And also remember, just because someone isn't fully awaken doesn't mean you can't learn a lot from them. So don't get too perfectionistic trying to find the perfect teacher. The most awake people are often poor teachers. Teaching ability is not at all the same as degree of awakening. The best teachers will likely be less awake than the most awakened people: precisely because they spend a lot time teaching! In the same way that the best mathematicians are not the best math teachers.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you are in doubt, just ask 5-MeO-DMT and it will tell you the truth -- assuming you're ready to stomach it. It will not lie to you. Your mind might lie. But 5-MeO does not. Every answer you want is there. You just have to dig it out a bit, which can take time. I will trust 5-MeO-DMT over any living master. Direct experience is king.

<p>
	Oh, yes! One can definitely have a direct consciousness of why it all exists.
</p>

<p>
	It's because something = nothing. In other words, reality cannot distinguish itself from nothing. It is being all states at once, so to speak. There is on one in reality to arbitrate between whether reality is happening or not. If you think it is happening, that's true for you. But you could also stop thinking that it's happening, and that will be true for you. Which is really true? Both and neither!
</p>

<p>
	You think there is something, but that something is not different from nothing. So it's sort of like reality never really happened. And yet it did. Paradox.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: infinity = zero.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. Existence is Nothing/Zero.
</p>

<p>
	Pick an object in your room, like a chair. Look at it. Now, try to see it as though it were a hologram from Star Wars. A hologram is like an object which exists (it has an appearance of a chair) but actually it is nothing. It has no substance. It is just a hollow appearance with nothing behind it.
</p>

<p>
	Yet another way to phrase it is like this: Imagine that reality never happened at all. Imagine there was only nothing. Well, congrats! because that's precisely the case! You're sitting in this nothing right now! You are right in the middle of that nothing. You must stop thinking of nothing as formlessness. You must see that form is identical to nothing too. The duality you create between something and nothing must be erased since it never existed to being with.
</p>

<p>
	In other words: nothing looks precisely like whatever you are seeing right now. Nothing is NOT the absence of appearances. Don't fall into that trap. You must learn to see appearances as nothing. Look at a chair and see it as nothing. Look at a cat and see it as nothing. Look at a wall and see it as nothing. Look at human and see it as nothing. Look at a tree and see it as nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nothing, nowhen, nowhere, nohow. And yet appearance is there.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: reality has nowhere else to be but where it already is: nowhere. It's like a deleted computer file which cannot go anywhere once it's deleted but into the void. And so there it exists, in the void.
</p>

<p>
	Yet another way you can think of it is: there is no difference between actual and potential. You can think of our physical world as just a possibility within the mind of God which only exists as a possibility, not as actuality, because there is no such thing as actuality. There is only possibility. Reality cannot distinguish between possibility and actuality. That is a duality which must collapse. Conversely you could say that there is only actuality with no possibility. Either way we are saying the same thing: the collapse of those categories. What happens when all categories collapse? Nothing!
</p>

<title>Will Science ever prove Non-Duality?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33025-will-science-ever-prove-non-duality/?do=findComment&amp;comment=392816</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14120-sqaad/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14120" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14120-sqaad/" rel="">@SQAAD</a> Science proved it 100 years ago with the radical epistemic discoveries of quantum mechanics. It just hasn't premeated mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you cannot prove something to a closedminded person no matter how much proof you have. If an ego-mind wishes to believe in materialism, no amount of proof will convince it otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	The way this problem is resolved is that culture must evolve. There must be a culture war to the point where materialism is so discredited that you would look like a fool to ever speak of it publicly. In the same way that you would look like a fool to say publicly that the Earth is 5000 years old. Serious people will laugh at you. So it must become with materialism.
</p>

<p>
	It will take hundreds of years for that to happen.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that the ego-mind does not allow its metaphysics to be open to being disproven. It is taken as fact/reality and you cannot change facts (or so the ego-mind believes). Of course there was nothing factual about materialist metaphysics to begin with. But this is denied by the materialist.
</p>

<p>
	It's a catch-22 situation. Individuals cannot realize it because culture is backwards. And culture cannot change because individuals are backwards. So it takes a long time for progress to occur. Generations must pass. The old dogmatic folks must natrually die off.
</p>

<p>
	This is one reason why death is good. If humans lived forever they would become totally rigid and stuck in their minds. Culture could not evolve. Technology could not happen as rapidly.
</p>

It is highly selective. Yet it is still EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	This part is paradoxical.

Max potency is not what you want. You want max clarity. I have not found anything yet with a higher clarity than 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	Yes, I have tried the other subtance. It was quite freaky. I would not recommend it to most people. It really warps your mind and has a high body load.

			Insights carry legitimate truths but they are stored in the frontal lobe, and merely by storing them due to their reductionist nature they distort and pervert. Are hijacked by the devil. Emotional highs, subconsious distortions are created without ones being the wiser. Look up the brahmanjala sutta. The Buddha talks about this at length in said sutta. 
		</p>

		<p>
			What is my point. If your stable level of consciousness is at one point and you jump deep into the depth of reality. The insights you carry back will be heavily perverted. Far more than you know. They will carry the stench of the devil. The ten defilements, and although they will sound good and reflect an actual reality. They will be far, far in purity. To the actuality.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ones mind needs to be trained to ingest an insight without perversion. Insights with heavy perversion can even be counterproductive. Eg there is nothing to do types in advaita.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my opinion the psychedelic path suffers heavily from this fact.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is some truth to what you are saying. Yes, it's important to be careful.
</p>

<p>
	But also you have to consider where many people would be who do psychedelics if they didn't do them. My suggestion is: in a far worse place. For example, if I had not done 5-MeO over the last 2 years, my teachings would be significantly worse and less truthful than they are now and I would never have been able to access the levels of consciousness, truth, insight, and purification through traditional meditation or self-inquiry. So what was I to do in this case?
</p>

<p>
	My point is, don't let perfection get in the way of one's growth. Most people who follow me are nowhere near capable of having 5-MeO levels of consciousness and insight sober through a few sits of meditation or self-inquiry. So what do you suggest they do? Your suggestions must be practical and workable for ordinary people. You cannot just assume that the person is spiritually gifted as it sounds like you have always been.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is not equal for all people. Some people have a much harder path than you. What is to be done with such people? Since most people are in fact like this, we cannot expect perfection from them. It's not about becoming fully awake, it's about helping them become MORE awake THAN THEY'VE BEEN.
</p>

<p>
	There is a process at work here. Yes, there are traps in the process. Every spiritual path has many traps. Psychedelics do have some unique traps. But they are also amazing and life-changing is very positive ways.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	They mostly agree that awakening = Absolute Truth = Nothing = Everything = God = Love = Consciousness
</p>

<p>
	It's just a question of how deeply you comprehend it, how much of its consequences you see, how well you embody it in everyday life, and how conscious you are of things. These vary greatly.
</p>

<p>
	There's also the issue of: how integral is your view of spirituality? For example, are you going to deny that Hindu's understand awakening? That Muslims do? That Jews do? That Buddhists do? Are you gonna pick one team and criticize all the others? Are you going to deny that people who use psychedelics have legit awakening experiences? Are you going to insist that self-inquiry is the one true way, or yoga, or Zen, or meditation? Are you going to insist that Jesus was the most awake, or Buddha, or someone else? Or are you gonna say that all awakened people are equally awake?
</p>

<p>
	There tends to be a lot of disagreement about all that mostly because the people disagreeing have not fully experienced and explored the things they're disagreeing with.
</p>

<p>
	Before you go disagreeing about 5-MeO-DMT, for example, how about you do 10 trips? Then let's talk.
</p>

<p>
	Before you go disagreeing about Islam, how about you travel to the Middle East and talk to 10 enlightened Sufi masters. Then let's talk.
</p>

<p>
	To really understand all this diversity there has to be genuine desire to understand it. You can't just cling to your POV while maintaining that everyone else is deluded.
</p>

<p>
	This understanding is not strictly-speaking enlightenment. It is a side pursuit. But in my opinion it is highly worthwhile. We are living more and more in an integrated world. We must learn to understand each other better, otherwise confusion, delusion, and evil happen.
</p>

Then again, paradox does not really exist. Paradox only exists within the realm of mind, when mind tries to articulate infinity. If you just sit and look at reality as it is without thought, there is no paradox.
</p>

<p>
	So the paradox is that there is no paradox, until you start to think about it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	"=" has nothing to do with math. It's a way of saying two things are one.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I could say: you = me. That's not math. It's a nondual truth.
</p>

<p>
	I could say:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I = God
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Love
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Intelligence
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Nothingness
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Infinity
	</li>
	<li>
		Ego = devil
	</li>
	<li>
		Fear = illusion
	</li>
	<li>
		Nonduality = Oneness
	</li>
	<li>
		Infinity = Zero
	</li>
	<li>
		Truth = Love
	</li>
	<li>
		Form = Formlessness
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Creation
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And these are all highly worthwhile realizations to have. You are not going to realize all these identities in one shot. This is why having multiple awakenings is so important.
</p>

<p>
	The above is actually a very elegant way of communicating the highest truths. In fact, I'll be doing a whole episode about these "equations".
</p>

<p>
	My formulations are just one way of expressing/communicating Truth. There are many other ways. Each way will be partial and emphasize different aspects of Truth/God. If you want the full Truth, then you must go beyond the words.
</p>

<p>
	The point here is: never take my words too literally. Always leave some leeway. Read between the lines. Grok the intention behind the communication.

	What you must realize is this:
</p>

<p>
	Something = Nothing
</p>

<p>
	Infinity = Zero
</p>

<p>
	Form = Formlessness
</p>

<p>
	Illusion = Reality
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the deepest awakenings you can have. You will not understand this logically. Only at the moment of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Asking if God cannot be without form assumes that form and formless are two, but they are in fact one.
</p>

<p>
	God is simultaneously without form (the Godhead) and all form which has ever occurred anywhere. It is both! It is ALL!
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate realization of nonduality is the unification of form and formlessness, so you see them as one. In this way, the everyday material world becomes nothing, like a divine hologram. Your body starts to feel light, like it is a ghost, like you are etherial.
</p>

<p>
	Etherial = ether = 5th element = nothingness = consciousness = love = God

Sure the mind can only express so much and even if your experience deepens it may translate into the same speech output. But the question is how this experienced depth translates into increased reverberation in your system and transforms you in a qualitative and long lasting way.

<p>
	This retreat was at least 10 times more profound and powerful for me. Maybe more.
</p>

<p>
	Words can't do it justice. The degrees of awakening and understanding are hard to capture in words. So to an outside observer it might all sound the same.
</p>

<p>
	"Leo, how many times can you say that you are God/nothingness/infinity? Haven't you said all this 2 years ago?" 
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but the degrees of it are lost in the communication.

<p>
	That distinction is somewhat moot.
</p>

<p>
	A Zen student strives very hard before and even after awakening. According to your logic you would say that all Zen is artificial. And by that standard all spirituality and all growth is artificial. Which is not a good view.
</p>

<p>
	Seeking to embody and to be more fully conscious of God is not artificial, it is a natural part of this whole awakening and self-transformation process. How else could it be?
</p>

<p>
	When transformation happens in you, you feel it. I am not saying that I am 100% transformed. It's not different than after any meditation retreat. You would be back, you would be somewhat transformed, but you would also still mostly be the old you. And you will have to work to embody the stuff you learned and realized during your retreat.
</p>

<p>
	Radical transformation does not happen over night. Realigning the mind is like realigning teeth with braces.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, to become fully God-realized will require some force and some contrivance. It is not going to be an effortless, purely organic process.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it interesting how much disagreement exists between people on this issue of awakening? I want you guys to notice that. How do you explain it?
</p>

<p>
	The very fact that this much disagreement exists -- and it exists not just on this forum but across ALL spiritual schools and teachings -- is evidence that there is far more than one degree and aspect of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is Absolute and One, but there are many degrees and facets to it and very few people have accessed all the degrees and facets. Hence the disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth/God was one-dimensional, there would be no disagreements amongst enlightened people, but there are! Take any two deeply enlightened people and you will likely find some disagreements between them in this point. Sometimes very stark disagreement.
</p>

<p>
	If you disagree with what I just said, that itself is evidence of what I am saying.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful when dismissing other people's POV as delusion
</p>

<p>
	Every great spiritual teacher I have come across acknowledges that there are degrees of awakening. Zen masters acknowledge it. Not just degrees of embodiment. Degrees of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	As God, you would realize your penis is Perfect and Good however it is.
</p>

<p>
	The desire for a bigger penis is devilry and lack of self-acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING is as it should be! You only need to purify yourself enough to see the truth of this.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you create your own hell by wanting a bigger penis. See? You are in heaven but you create a hell out of it. That is the core mistake of humans.

			The way Leo talks about the Absolute- I mean things like infinity, god, how a chair is infinite, how the 20 years old memory still existing now, how his human body is literally God's body etc and etc; don't these declarations subtly imply the existence of an independent universe with strict laws and regulations out of which nothing exist?
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It all exists as nothingness/emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	It exists sort of like a hologram in Star Wars. Here it is, but its substance is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	What I was describing was how the infinite hologram works.
</p>

<p>
	The illusion does exist. Otherwise you wouldn't see, hear, or feel anything. Form exists. It's just that form and formlessness are one. And form is always changing from the human POV while formlessness does not change.

<p>
	Hmmm... so it sounds like the main issue is that it doesn't dissolve as well. That's somewhat of a shame. HCl dissolves within seconds very easily, just like table salt or sugar would.
</p>

<p>
	That might affect the plugging method. Although I would think it should still work.
</p>

<p>
	The plugging method requires that your bowls be empty. Very important. And you want to plug it not too deep, but also not too shallow. It takes some practice but I perfected my technique such that it works consistently almost every time.
</p>

<p>
	20mg of HCl is enough for a breakthrough for me. Although that will be too little for most people. I have seen people take 20mg of HCl without anything close to a breakthrough like I get on exactly the same dose and substance. So individual variablity is a real issue.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, thanks for sharing.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder if there is an easy method of converting Oxalate to HCl?
</p>

<p>
	I haven't found it any harder than integrating insights from a 10 day Vipassana retreat.
</p>

<p>
	Integration is core to all spiritual practice. Do not assume you will just awaken and become an angel without a TON of integration work.
</p>

<p>
	There is more work in integration than there is in having the awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing 30 days of Vipassana and then go spend a week living with your mother and see how that goes. See if you can keep your Vipassana insights while living with your mother.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to keep your Vipassana insights when you meditate for 8 hours a day in a cave non-stop while someone else prepares your food for you. It's much harder when you have to run a business, raise a family, attract a mate, cook your own food, do your own taxes, etc.

You are judging is improperly when you judged it like so: If it fully enlightens me in one go, then it's good. If it doesn't, then it's bad and useless.
</p>

<p>
	If you're gonna use that criterion, then you should apply it equally to meditation. Like so: if I sit down and meditate for 30 minutes and it fully enlightens me, then I will do it and it's good. But if doesn't, then it's bad and I'm never going to meditate again.
</p>

<p>
	How many meditation sits does it take to become stably awakened? 1000? 5000? 10,000?
</p>

<p>
	Now apply those numbers to psychedelics. So your comparison is fair.
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you did 1000 trips? Would you become stably awake? If so, you'd beat mediation by 10x.
</p>

<p>
	Why do I have a deeper understanding of metaphysical reality than Shinzen Young, who has 40 years of professional practice while I have less than 5 years of amateur practice? How do you explain that? There's some facts and statistics for ya.
</p>

<p>
	You see, there's more to this than just awakening. You must look at psychedelics as a holistic tool for self-awareness, personal development, and mental health.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say. You can only know by doing both and seeing which one gets you higher.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is gonna be hard to beat. You could only beat it if you devoted your entire life to full-time practice. You basically would have no life but meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The real answer is to do both. They complement each other perfectly. Nothing I realize on 5-MeO-DMT really contradicts what the most advanced yogis say. The alignment is uncanny.
</p>

<p>
	If 5-MeO somehow revealed truths which were the opposite of what the most advanced yogis say, then we would have a serious problem, as you would not know which to trust. But if they are 90% aligned, then there's no problem.

			Is it not possible that by doing consciousness practices for years and years, one actually creates a process for becoming more conscious which exponentially increases consciousness so that it seems like, for someone who has not practice long enough, it would be impossible to reach consciousness levels as high as one does with psychedelics?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course, that's exactly what it takes, decades of industrial-grade practice which virtually no one is ready to do.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that most people are not full-time yogis. So what good is it to tell people: become a full-time yogi, otherwise you will not understand anything I teach?
</p>

<p>
	What we need are efficient ways of communicating these powerful insights. 10 to 20 years of practice is not within the realm of reality for most people. So we need something more effective. Someone who is going to do these practices hardcore for 20 years is already fully-bought in. You are preaching to the choir when teaching him. The real issue is, how do you teach to new people? People who are not part of the choir.
</p>

<p>
	That's where psychedelics come in.
</p>

<p>
	And also don't forget, there are many Zen masters and teachers who still have never accessed levels of consciousness as high as 5-MeO-DMT can deliver within 15 minutes. So 20 years of practice is no guarantee whatsoever that you will beat out 5-MeO-DMT. Can someone like Sadhguru beat out 5-MeO? Probably, but that's totally irrelevant because that helps no one. That is like saying that Arnold can lift 500 pounds. Yes, he can, but your sister can't. She needs to use a forklift.
</p>

<p>
	The point of technology is to make things which almost no one can do accessible to everyone easily.
</p>

<p>
	Could you imagine how backwards it would be if everyone had to be computer programmer in order to use a computer or smart phone? Or a pilot in order to use an airplane? Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	Think about how backwards it is that a person must spend 20 years of his life chasing an enlightenment experience.
</p>

So it's not about not being excited, it's about realizing that excitement is happening within the emptiness that is your true nature. Trying to achieve some monotone state is not the goal, nor will you ever succeed in that. You can have emotional ups and downs while being conscious and detached from them.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional range is good and healthy. Don't try to be monotone. Laugh & cry.

<title>Emotional Problems Sub-Forum</title>

<p>
	Also understand that a significant percentage of the general population has serious emotional issues to work through. So banning such talk is not going to eliminate the problem. It will only make it worse. At least here people can vent and get some decent pointers/resources. By eliminating this sub-forum people would have to keep all that pent up inside them with no one to talk to. And of course it would inevitably spill over into the other sub-forums.
</p>

<p>
	It's not self-actualization or this forum which is causing these serious emotional problems. They are pre-existing conditions. A psychologically healthy person is not going to come to this forum and leave sick or suicidal. So don't blame the existence of this forum for these issues. This is just a place for people to express themselves. Expect to see a lot of ego expressed here.
</p>

<p>
	I have noticed that when someone here is truly feeling suicidal, people on this forum try to do what they can to help them. But even so, some people are in such bad shape psychologically that forum talk is not going to heal them. How else could it be? With thousands of people visiting this forum, we are gonna some really dysfunctional cases which might even be beyond help (at least help via online).
</p>

</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Like I have said to the devils that lurk here, don't think for a minute that I don't see through your games.
</p>

<p>
	As far as seriously suicidal people, those we should treat with compassion and try to help them, but only if they ask for our help. If a person does not want any help (even if they are suicidal) then that is their choice and we are not to impose our will and our desires on them. Keep in mind that people have a right to commit suicide and you should not judge them for it if that is what they really want.
</p>

<p>
	If a person truly wants help with a serious emotional issue, they will ask for help. And they will receive it.
</p>

<p>
	But keep in mind that the ego-mind loves to use threats of suicide to play games, get sympathy, get attention, etc. So do take such threats with a grain of salt. If someone really wanted to commit suicide they would just do it. They would not brag about it on a forum, trying to fish for attention -- that is all ego.

Just because something works for you doesn't mean it will work for everyone. So stay humble with your advice. Health issues can be very complex, multi-factorial, and personal.

	Your fantasies about my right knee are purely your own projections.
</p>

<p>
	Do not stick your nose in other people's health issues as if you know them.
</p>

<p>
	The point of the money is to afford the medical treatments (which tend to be expensive). If <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/9989-fountainbleu/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="9989" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/9989-fountainbleu/" rel="">@Fountainbleu</a> didn't have a money shortage, then this situation would be much easier to handle. Not everyone can just take months off from work to heal. That is a luxury which assumes you've got money to burn through.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking I am very against anti-depressants. But if there is no other way, then you must do what you must do to survive.

	It has.

<p>
	The most amazing thing about reality is that it is intelligible. Nothing is arbitrary.

<p>
	Human logic is a tiny splinter off God's logic.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just patterns and survival. I'm talking about understanding the metaphysical structure of reality and why it is the way it is. There is no accident or randomness to it. It has a Logos.

Are you saying that all of these social anxiety issues started after your car crash?? You didn't have them before?
</p>

<p>
	Brain trauma is a serious thing and requires serious treatment, not merely spiritual techniques. There are supplements and various EEG brain training methods which might help you a lot. Research neurofeedback brain training.
</p>

<p>
	You can also contact the Dr Amen brain clinic in California. I know they do great work when it comes to assessing and healing brain injury. Or find another similar provider.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus on doing whatever it takes to heal your brain injury because you are gonna have to live with it for life and it will seriously affect your earning potential.
</p>

<p>
	If you need to take some meds to start a biz to earn the money to heal your brain, that is a good plan if you cannot afford to heal yourself immediately.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a link to Dr Amen's clinic:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.amenclinics.com" rel="external nofollow">https://www.amenclinics.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	You should also do research into brain injury recovery. Many books have been written on the subject. Educate yourself on the best ways to heal.

<p>
	Things are not just as they are. They are a very specific way, a very deliberate and intelligent way. Everything is intelligible. It is possible to become conscious of why every hair on your arm exists exactly as it does and not otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to understand why the whole universe exists. Profound awakening required of course. This is no ordinary reason. You must penetrate the very structure of God. It has a logic to it.
