<p>
	Consciousness & lots of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You have many, many layers of inauthenticity to shed. It's difficult to see how deep your inauthenticity goes without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Deep authenticity is impossible so long as you are dominated by fear and survival -- and the ego is all about fear and survival.

<p>
	That is the crux of the matter.
</p>

<p>
	That is gonna limit your growth. The highest wisdom will not be supported by society at all. You will be all on your own. In fact, people will tear your down and demonize you and call you crazy. And you have to be wise and strong enough to laugh off their ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorant people love to gaslight the wise with their ignorance. You gotta rise above this kinda thing because you will encounter it a lot going forward. I get it on a daily basis.

<p>
	If you are male, female itself is your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	You are not really male or female. Both are dualities. You include and transcend both.
</p>

<p>
	Work more on integrating your feminine. That's part of what gayness is about.

<p>
	A) American healthcare has massive profit margins. You cannot compare it to other countries. Cutting those profit margins is very hard because they don't want to give it up. It's like taking away crack from an addict.
</p>

<p>
	B) If all the sick people are offloaded onto public plans, public plans will pay all the cost while private plans will offer cheap insurance for healthy people who don't need it. For the public plan to be affordable it needs to contain many healthy people to offset the sick ones. This is how insurance works.
</p>

<p>
	Having a single giant pool is ideal. Then everyone is invested in it and no one can manipulate it or want to cut it.
</p>

<p>
	People on private plans will want to cut public plans because it doesn't benefit them.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Which is why private plans are not allowed in many countries which have a public system.

I'm telling you from personal experience at 18 I had a permanent enlightenment experience that put me in the now due to nearly a decade of depression and suicidality. It made depression go away and it felt like peace on steroids with a sense of awe and wonder that I can tap into to this day. Yes I can say that experience is real. However the idea of everything having consciousness has not come to me. I'm more than open to it I am a truth seeker however as of yet I've not reached that truth. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, I mean enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your experience was, it could have been a genuine awakening but it was still just like dipping your toe in the ocean.
</p>

<p>
	There is much deeper and wider to go.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and facets to awakening. Deep and total awakening is extremely rare. Mostly people get glimpses.
</p>

<p>
	You have much more to contemplate and understand.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you are not conscious of what consciousness is, what reality is, or what other is. Which is why you ask your question.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully awake you would not be asking if rocks have consciousness.

<p>
	Nothing "has" consciousness. Consciousness has all things. Your paradigm is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	How can you know? By awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You are not doing the practices. That doesn't fly in this work.

<p>
	This is fairly typical if you go deep into the work.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is not controlling you. The devil is purely imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	If you're feeling lost and down, you can lean on the power of love.
</p>

<p>
	Self-love is what you are missing.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can give you a powerful love awakening which really helps to take the sting out of this work.

	Look, people have different genetics, brains, and psyches. They process things differently and chemicals affect them differently.

<p>
	Clearly psychedelics are not for him.

<p>
	Sounds like he is extremely sensitive to them and he has zero foundation for it.

<p>
	Don't forget that some people actually are psychotic, psychopathic, etc.

<p>
	There is no robot consciousness. There is no human consciousness. There is just consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're asking, "Is the goal of my TV screen to become Mario? Or robot Mario?" No! The goal of your TV screen is be free of attachment from any shape so that it can display all shapes.

</p>

<p>
	"Niv Sch" will confuse people because it will mean nothing to them. They will not even recognize that as your name and they won't know how to pronounce it or spell it.
</p>

<p>
	It is helpful to create a catchy brand name that's unique and easy to remember and pronounce. That alone won't ever make you successful or popular, but having a low quality brand name just makes your life needlessly difficult.
</p>

<p>
	If I named by channel: "dksfulxkjNdfww", that would be a problem.

<p>
	You're misunderstanding a few key points.
</p>

<p>
	1) All models are limited. There is no such thing as "a valid model".
</p>

<p>
	2) You are expecting a social consensus and authority on cutting edge insights which almost no humans know about. That's not how knowledge works. Maybe in 100 years you will have that. But by that point your presention will be useless because everyone will already know it. The whole point of cutting edge teachings is that people will deny them like subborn mules. So this idea of using authority firgures to prove your point is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	3) You need to spend a lot more time studying Spiral Dynamics and developmental psychology in genernal before you can appreciate what SD offers and its limitations.
</p>

<p>
	4) SD is a very complex model which maps very complex phenomena. This is not like mapping a few molecules or billard balls, which is easy compared to mapping the collective human psyche.
</p>

<p>
	You are bastardizing the notion of self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	The real self-deception here is thinking you know anything about the future.
</p>

<p>
	The truth here is very simple: nobody knows what will happen in 2020 until it happens. Everything here is guesswork and speculation.
</p>

<p>
	It is okay to speculate sometimes. But at least be honest with yourself that you are speculating.
</p>

<p>
	Claiming that something as dicey as the 2020 election is inevitable is the very definition of self-deception and goes against everything I teach.
</p>

<p>
	Accept that you just don't know. That is truthful.
</p>

<p>
	You are not surrendering to reality here, you are constructing fantasies and confusing them for reality.
</p>

<title>Does this 5-MeO-DMT look good?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	That is an acceptable texture and color.
</p>

<p>
	Texture and color of 5-Meo-DMT can vary quite a bit. Depends on which lab made it. Depends on freebase vs HCl vs oxalate. But don't assume that all freebase or all HCl looks the same. There is still a lot of variety in texture and color. Some is like a very dry fine powder. Some is almost sticky and clumpy. Some is more crystal-like.
</p>

<p>
	None of that matters so long as it's 98%+ pure 5-MeO-DMT. Which it probably is if it's 5-MeO-DMT at all. If a lab is capable of making 5-MeO-DMT at all, it doesn't cost them anything to make it 98% pure. There is little point in cutting research chemicals with junk. It's not cocaine or heroin which gets cut with junk by a long chain of middlemen to drive down costs. The research chemical industry doesn't work that way.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest risk with research chemicals is if they accidentally give you the wrong substance simply due to mislabeling it.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO has a subtle distinctive smell you can learn to distinguish. This makes for a nice easy sniff test. It's not fool proof, but a good way to make sure it's on the right track.
</p>

<p>
	You are not conscious of what you are doing. You create suffering because you are attached to being a self and staying alive.
</p>

<p>
	To stop creating suffering you'd have to die. But that's unacceptable to you.
</p>

<p>
	You're stuck inside your own insane dream, not understanding how you locked yourself inside. Awakening is the process of investigating how you locked yourself inside.

<p>
	Ideally you'd get to a point where you are satisfied with just sitting silence. But that's a tall order to fill.
</p>

<p>
	I like to take late night drives around town and look at the city.
</p>

<p>
	Act activity you do you're gonna eventually "wear out" unless you're able to be satisfied just sitting in silence like a cat.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind constantly craves stimulation, excitement, and newness -- which creates suffering. A large part of the function of meditation is to train that out of you so you can be more cat-like and thrive off of presence and being alone. But again, this takes lots of training and it will come with suffering through lots of boredom which the ego-mind will create.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a state of mental development in which you are happier sitting like a cat than others are playing video games, watching movies, smoking pot, or having sex. Can you see how powerful this would make you?

	For example, how much time and money does a lady spend shopping and applying makeup in her life? How much energy does she invest in building and maintaining a social circle that later feeds her vetted mates? 1000s of hours go into this for attractive females.
</p>

<p>
	Mating is a highly sophisticated game which goes on under the radar of our consciousness. It's more sophisticated than a game of chess. But all of it just happens automatically.

That's very common for newbies. As you fail over and over again you'll start seeing patterns in how your needy and weak behavior turns them off.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of practice.
</p>

<p>
	At this point you would benefit from learning a bit of the fundamental theory behind female attraction. Most important for you is correcting your sub-communication: your eye contact, your body posture, your tone of voice, your physical touching, your smile, your attitude, your presence, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is the most important part of game. It's not the things you say, its how and why you say them, and the things you don't say.
</p>

<p>
	You can attract women just by looking at them in the right way.
</p>

<p>
	If your interactions are dominated by fear, neediness, attachment, trying to impress her, trying to get her to like you, meekness, or being a dancing monkey -- you will lose a lot of girls.
</p>

<p>
	It's important that your interactions carry a man-to-woman sexual charge/intent. When you look at her in the eyes, she should feel like if you are ever alone with her you will fuck her. This is very different from your typical friendly chit-chat. You don't need to say anything sexual, but your intent needs to be clear from the very beginning. Look at her like you're going to fuck her. You have to risk getting rejected. Those who don't reject you will hook hard.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fearful, she can see it in your eyes and hear it in your tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
	Work on your smile. Make sure you're able to smile a lot and on cue. Always open with a smile.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to pump up your own emotional state so that you're in a good state when you're talking to her. State is huge. If you're in a bad emotional state she will sense it off you and react negatively.
</p>

<p>
	The ideal state is playful, carefree, yet decisive.
</p>

			You said elsewhere also that god is maximizing love, does that mean it always is developing toward even more love? Or is Infinite love not something that can grow and is always as it is, what does maximizing love mean then?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on what perspective you take.
</p>

<p>
	From the absolute perspective, there is no time, so Infinity unfolds at once. It has always been completely acutalized. From the human perspective Infinity unfolds linearly over time.
</p>

<p>
	Doesn't matter which way look at it, the structure of all of reality is explained by the desire to maximize Love. From God's POV this Love is already fully actualized while from the human POV this love is in the process of unfolding, evolving, and increasing. And actually, we humans are in a process of co-creating it.
</p>

<p>
	So imagine a film director who wanted to make a movie that displayed love in the most loving way possible. Which scenes would he put int he movie? Whichever ones maximized love. Then the audience would watch the movie and see it unfolding slowly over time. But from the director's POV, the movie is already complete. In either case, the movie is maximizing love.
</p>

<p>
	But there is one additional wrinkle. To truly maximize love God had to create an infinite number of beings who could participate in the co-creation of the movie. So it's like the movie director created a trillion other movie directors and gave them an opportunity to direct one scene each for his epic mega-movie -- all of which would add up to The Love Movie.
</p>

<p>
	Love is maximized by creating an infinite number of beings and giving each of them the opportunity to realize that they are God. All of reality is structured so this happens. This includes war, genocide, terrorism, murder, rape, theft, slavery, and everything else. All of it is necessary so that each being can experience being God.
</p>

<p>
	But God's Love is so infinite no finite being can handle it. It kills everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Death is Infinite Love and it is the last thing a finite being wants.
</p>

<p>
	You will die precisely because God loves you. But you are too ignorant and selfish to understand that. The good news is, you will die anyway. You are powerless to stop it. You can resist for a while, but eventually everyone succumbs to Truth and wakes up.
</p>

<p>
	The awakening process is going on. A tug of war between devil-consciousness and God-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The devil will not go quietly.
</p>

<p>
	Purifying a lifetime of selfish habits, attachments, and defilements requires years of serious, deliberate work. It will NOT happen automatically overnight.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening will NOT erase all your defilements. If only it were so easy. The mind and body have a very strong inertia. Changing them is like derailing a freight train by throwing tennis balls.

<title>Psychedelic Reverse Tolerance</title>

<p>
	Of course. If that wasn't the case, how could people reach high states of consciousness without any psychedelics at all?
</p>

<p>
	The more psychedelics you do the more you will realize that there is no difference between a trip and real life. They are identical. You are always high.
</p>

<p>
	The more you trip the more your mind tunes into seeing the Absolute. And the psychedelics purify the mind and body of defilements which limit consciousness.

</p>

<p>
	Sex happens all the time for the dumbest reasons. All you need to do is go out and talk to girls.
</p>

<p>
	Sex cannot happen while you sit at home on the internet.
</p>

<p>
	All your attention should be on going out of your house and being face to face with lots of new girls. That's it. Do not worry about anything else.
</p>

<p>
	If you put yourself in lots of social situations girls will want to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	Tons of girls will reject you. It doesn't matter. Don't even think about it. Get rejected 10 times a day and you will stop caring.

<p>
	You can use research chems and other psychedelics like LSD, mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, DPT, etc. and accomplish an epic amount of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't limit yourself to one substance.

<p>
	As I have said elsehwhere, the "plan" is Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you see is what Infinite Love looks like, including all demons and devils.
</p>

<p>
	The plan is complete perfection and it is fully actualized at all times and in all places for eternity.

<p>
	You/God are Infnite Love. Here you are! Ta-da!

</p>

<p>
	Nice guys and socially awkward guys aren't necessary fake. But you girls still don't like them.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is not based on ideals or unconditional love. It is blind survival and there's nothing "fair" or "honest" about it.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, don't take my word for it. Discover for yourselves how mating works.
</p>

<p>
	If you observe it carefully you should see that it's pure selfishness on both sides. It can be quite disgusting when you really look into it. After all, you would not be mating at all if not for survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, you don't mate with your vacuum cleaner. Why not?
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe some of you do? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> But again, that would also be purely to satisfy your survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	For this reason the male and female perspectives on mating when never be fully reconcilable because they are not interested in truth or fairness, they are interested in maximizing survival while justifying it as truth. So the key here is to notice the self-bias of both sides. You and your partner are both biased and in denial about it.
</p>

<title>Why I can't get laid just behaving authentically? Why I have to follow the rules?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Also remember that girls are not saints. Fundamentally mating is about survival for both man and women alike. So of course you will be judged by how well you fit into the other's survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	Girls are not obligated to love you no matter how you are. If your authentic way of acting is to be serial killer or some creeper, girls will rightfully reject you.
</p>

<p>
	Being authentic does not guarantee any level of results. Usually when we say "be authentic" we assume you will be acting within certain norms and criteria which girls find valuable and attractive.
</p>

<p>
	It can be easy to fool oneself into thinking that one's neuroses, bad habits, lack of socialization, and egotistical quirks are "authentic".
</p>

<p>
	Ex: Farting when you feel like it might be authentic, but don't expect it to attract girls off the street.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Reasonable people can disagree about how best to implement universal healthcare. Bernie's plan doesn't have to be the only way. Although I think it's a good idea to kill private insurance because they drive up costs too much while adding zero value.
</p>

<p>
	A universal healthcare plan which does not have a mechanism for cutting out gluttonous corporate profits is not really a plan at all. The key problem is affordability and profiteering. It is not possible to cover 330 million people while maintaining existing corporate profit margins. The profit margins are what needs to be attacked via a populist movement.

<p>
	Why would you think you're going backwards?
</p>

<p>
	Just because it's a difficult experience doesn't mean a damn thing. In fact, it means it's growing you -- the devil in you just doesn't like being purified.
</p>

<p>
	How did you think this awakening process would go? Did you really think you could awaken yet still keep the devil in you? And did you expect the devil to go quietly without bitching?
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's massively frustrating to awaken. Which is the only reason virtually nobody does it.
</p>

<p>
	Frustration is the cost of success.

<p>
	It's a sort of play.
</p>

<p>
	When you go to the movies, how come you care so much about what the characters are doing? You're there for fun. You know it's not real but you got nothing better to do.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, meaninglessness is a big paradox. It is difficult for the ego-mind, which has been addicted to constructing illusory meanings all its life, to suddenly operate without meaning. There is a difficult transition phase here which can last months or years, where the ego-mind will feel lost and directionless. But then you stabilize in emptiness and play.
</p>

<p>
	The point of life is PLAY! It's just like a video game. The mistake is that you take it too seriously because you are terrified of death and suffering. Imagine how bad video games would be if the main character was terrified of death?

</p>

<p>
	Consider that life having zero meaning is the ideal situation. It gives you total freedom to play. It's an infinite sand box game this way. Otherwise you'd be a slave to some limited set of pre-baked meanings. This would make life boring and lame.
</p>

<p>
	YOU. ARE. GOD! Invent whatever the fuck you want. It's all your whim.

	Stop assuming there ever was a dimitri character. There never was a dimitri. It is just a thought + feeling.

	Watch my video about The Role Of Balance In Personal Development.
</p>

<p>
	Balance is a tricky business. You cannot ever formalize it because it is dynamic.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well ask me, "So how do I balance myself on a unicycle?"
</p>

<p>
	By doing it. No one can tell you in words how to do it.
</p>

<p>
	You should expect to fall over many, many times before you master it.

<p>

<p>
	Of course words are arbitrary sounds. That's just how words work. There is nothing special about the letters "God", it's just something we human settled on. I could call it "pineapple" but that would confuse you even more.
</p>

<p>
	The way language works is that we establish a consensus about what difference words point to. Now you're trying to question this consensus and change it around willy-nilly. You can do that, but as soon as you do the entire language structure falls apart and becomes useless. So be careful about being too clever for your own good. Language is a pragmatic tool we use in this work. It can never reach the Absolute but it can point to it. Which is exactly what the word God does. It is a pointer. And it is a damn accurate pointer. Do not assume that this pointer was invented by fools. It was invented by geniuses much wiser than you.
</p>

<p>
	When you actually experience God, you will immediately understand why we call it God and not pineapple.

<p>
	There is always a benefit to exploring different psychedelics. Each one shows you something unique and valuable.
</p>

<p>
	If all you learned was that 5-MeO-DMT is better for your aims than N,N-DMT, that would be a valuable lesson. But my guess is N,N-DMT will hold a lot more lessons for you than that.
</p>

<p>
	You never know what lessons you'll learn until you try.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, but there is a big question as to what degree.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, even after decades of consciousness work you will still not have enough consciousness to turn a computer into a demon.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate how sophisticated this imagination mechanism is. It literally IS physical reality. So it's not as easy to imagine things willy-nilly as you might naively expect. Your ability to manipulate physical reality for selfish purposes is tightly limited and regulated, otherwise a devil could really cause some damage.
</p>

<p>
	You are like an app running in a tightly controlled operating system environment. The OS does not grant you permission to access the most critical variables for your own safety. Otherwise you could easily kill yourself, blow up the world, or just go totally insane.
</p>

<p>
	The human life is a dumb-down kiddie pool, designed for morons so they don't accidentally kill themselves. And even so, many folks even manage to drown themselves in this knee-deep kiddie pool.
</p>

<p>
	You are far too selfish, unconsciousness, and unintelligent to be given full root access to reality. Actually, the only thing that's stopping you is your selfishness. It is impossible to have full root access as a finite self. Full root access is identical to infinite selflessness -- which you are incapable of in your human form.
</p>

<p>
	Full root access is only possible if you leave the human form forever. In fact, you would have to leave all form forever. To have full root access you'd need to become Absolutely Nothing. But then no one would even know you exist. You would be so all-powerful that you would totally remove yourself from physical manifestation. Which is to say, you would be so all-powerful your body would become identical to all physical manifestation.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is already the case, but right now you're stuck thinking you are a human. Until the day you wake up.
</p>

<p>
	You could call it a kind of experience, but like a null experience. The experience of no experience or pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It feels a lot like emptiness. It's so empty you cannot even feel it as being empty, because that's still not empty enough.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<ol>
			<li>
				Is "experiencing perceptions" itself another perception?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	"Experience" and "perception" are concepts which are already loaded with a hidden assumption of an experience and an experiencer.
</p>

<p>
	What you have thought of as "experience" your whole life is actually the body of God.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately experience isn't experience. Experience is an improperly understood BEING. Being is not experienced or perceived. Being just is. You cannot get any more fundamental than Being. You cannot ask, "But who is experiencing Being?" Because at the level of Being there is no who and experience.
</p>

				The problem with observing You with capital Y is you haven't figured out "YOU" yet. Anything you observe as "YOU" is not the real You. 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You with a capital Y cannot be observed. YOU is! Again, "observation" is a loaded concept which assumes a subject/object duality which is illusory.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Subjective/objective is a duality. We are talking about nonduality here, which means that you cannot ask if it is subjective or objective because there is no difference between anything in nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	What is a dream? A dream is when you think there is a difference between any two things, including the difference between a dream and not-a-dream.
</p>

<p>
	Is there a difference between a kangaroo and a refrigerator? If you said YES, then you're dreaming. You are dreaming that difference! The difference seems "real" precisely because you are dreaming it! A dream is when something, anything, seems "real".
</p>

<p>
	You are even dreaming the difference between "real" and "unreal". There is no such difference unless you dream it.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Consciousness cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is not.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is imagining all of reality. If you start imagining devils enough, they will become real for you, just like anything else.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are imagining that you are a human, sitting here reading this computer screen and interacting with another human called Leo.
</p>

<p>
	Demons are no different. Just replace "computer screen" with demon or whatever else you want.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in practice you do not have anywhere near enough control of your consciousness to alter what you are imagining right now. That would requires decades of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness means that anything you encounter in the world is your own imagination. Right now you are imagining me. You could also imagine a demon.

<p>
	Unfortunately, of course, it won't fly. Too radical even for most Dems. At least for now. It will take some decades for the Overton window to shift on drug legalization. Legalizing weed nationwide is the first most important step. We're getting close. Should happen within the next decade.

	You might as well be talking about space kangaroos. You have a more accurate idea of what a space kangaroo is than what God is.

<p>
	And yet, you are still God. That's the depth of this problem.

<p>
	There's a bit of a hypocrisy about sex in the woman's mind. She likes it. She will often have it frequently will random dudes. But then she will deny having done so because she doesn't want to appear easy or slutty.
</p>

<p>
	From the guy's perspective it's frustrating because the more a guy tries to be a nice guy, the less his chances of sleeping with the girl. She often sleeps with the fun asshole instead because he makes her feel spontaneous. Girls rarely reward nice guys. So we are incentivized to be jerks.
</p>

<p>
	The more a guy cares about a girl, the less likely she is to sleep with him. If a guy is totally detached about a girl, the higher his odds of sleeping with her. That's the paradox of attraction.
</p>

<p>
	From the guy's POV, total detachment until sex is necessary for success. You cannot invest in her at all until sex. And the guys who are best at that are total asshole players. So they get laid the most. It requires an almost sociopathic level of detachment. So ironically, the hottest girls reward sociopaths the most. And of course that makes perfect sense from the POV of survival. The more selfish the better, until it comes back to bite you in the ass. The problem with dating a sociopath is that he also doesn't give a damn about you.

<p>
	Pickup is a lot like Zen. The harder your try to act how you should, the less you will succeed.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately all that good pickup is teaching you is:
</p>

<p>
	1) Go talk to lots of girls!<br />
	2) Be authentic, don't be a dancing monkey, and be willing to get rejected for who you are. This will look different for each guy because authenticity is relative.<br />
	3) Don't be socially awkward or creepy.
</p>

<p>
	But to really learn these lessons you gotta go out a lot and fail a lot. You will try to impress girls a 1000 different creepy ways until you learn it.
</p>

<p>
	95% of your results from pickup simply come from you going out every night and approaching. The theory only accounts for the other 5%. So don't waste too much time worrying about the theory. You learn by going out and talking to females. The theory will tend to put you inside your head, doubting yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you've been having success is simply because you've been going out. If you go out long enough, sex will randomly fall on your lap. Some nights you will get laid for no good reason whatsoever, simply because you happened to be in the right place at the right time.
</p>

<p>
	God has nothing to do with human language or human culture or human tradition. Humans are unreal. You are not a human. You are just pretending to be a human.
</p>

<p>
	YOU. ARE. GOD.
</p>

<p>
	There is no other more accurate word for your true nature. "The Universe", "The All", "Existence", etc. are all misleading. You prefer such words because you do not want to admit that you are God. You are looking for a safe word which denies your truest nature.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand what God is until you realize you are it. And once you do, you'll understand everything I said and why I said it. And until then, you will not.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand what God is without awakening.
</p>

<p>
	"What is God?" << Now that's a great question to contemplate. God cannot be explained to you by anyone because you are God and are the only one. If you do not realize what God is, God will forever remain cut off from itself until the day you die. Your death will be the end of your denial.

<p>
	The way people in mainstream culture throw around the word "cult", they use it to disparage any POV which contradicts the ones they're comfortable with. It's often a materialist defense mechanism. But of course materialism is the biggest cult of all.
</p>

<p>
	See my 2 part series on Cult Psychology to really understand how deep this issue goes.
</p>

<p>
	The most amazing thing about cults is that people don't realize they're in one. But if that's true, how do you know you weren't in one since birth?

	That's all fine and good. But are you conscious that you are God?

<p>
	It's all too easy to get lost in philosophy while missing the truth which is right under your nose.

<p>
	No book or philosophy can take you where you ultimately want to go.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, my style and communication are mostly on display for all to see.
</p>

<p>
	It's not really worthwhile to teach style to people because they need to find their own style and method which is authentic to who they are. It's a trap to try to follow directly in my footsteps. Rather you can teach and mentor people but do it in a way that most aligns with you. Develop your own style and method. That's how you'll really shine.
</p>

<p>
	The world does not need more Leo's. It needs you to be fully, authentically you.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest traps with having teachers and mentors is that you start to copy them too much. To really flourish in life you must eventually let go of your teachers and mentors and go your own way. Like a bird leaving the nest.

	What I was trying to communicate to you, and what you still refuse to see, is that all of this is still self-survival.
</p>

<p>
	Self-survival is a much bigger and more sophisticated notion than simply putting food in your belly. Your entire worldview is part of your "self" and what must survive. This of course includes all your notions of fairness, justice, morality, good/bad, social justice, good government, equality, and so on.

	You are being a child. We are just doing the work here. Don't make this personal.
</p>

<p>
	Important lessons are being taught to you right here which you still have yet to understand.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most common problems I see with my students is that they learn a bit from me and then all the sudden they think they have all of life figured out and that now they know better then everyone, including me. This is self-deception 101. You have many years of learning left before you understand how deep all of this really goes. So far you have only licked the surface of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that no one is personally attacking you here. All that's being pointed out is your survival patterns.
</p>

<p>
	What I was doing what robbing you of your justifications for your political position. Because all justifications are biased fabrications of the ego-mind. That is the lesson here.
</p>

<p>
	Realize that all justification are bullshit. They are not true in any objective sense. Justifications are manipulations of the mind. This can be a painful lesson to learn, but well worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Again, none of this is personal. It's just survival.

<p>
	The name of your channel is irrelevant to its popularity.
</p>

<p>
	Achieving popularity is a lot harder than finding a popular name. It's about creating the right kind of content and marketing it in the right ways to the right people.
</p>

<p>
	If you get those 3 things right you could name your channel HairyMonkeyBallz and it would do great.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful naming things using your full real name because everything you put out will be permanently tied to you forever. It's very easy to screw up your reputation forever.
</p>

<p>
	That is more survival.
</p>

<p>
	You are doing survival.
</p>

<p>
	That's fine. But our work here is to become conscious of how survival biases our view of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take it personally.
</p>

<p>
	I pointed out your survival to you and you took offense (which is a doubling down on survival). Totally understandable. But it has nothing to do with truth.
</p>

<p>
	It's impossible to transcend survival if you get offended about your survival being pointed out to you.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be conscious politics without awareness of one's survival biases. What your post did was unconscious politics.
</p>

<p>
	Please don't make this about me. I am irrelevant.

	You definely need to use a scale to calibrate your microscoops. You have no clear idea how much you actually took. Your numbers could be way off.

<p>
	You cannot atomize these things. They are deeply interconnected.
</p>

<p>
	That is the chief delusion men have, they want to treat sex and relationships as indepedent variables where for women it is not like that.
</p>

<p>
	You can have some quick sex and run off. She has to worry about dealing with a pregnancy. But of course you don't care about that risk as much as her.
</p>

<p>
	Sex for men and women is not symmetrical as men assume.

It's curiosity and the love of exploration. And nothing is lost if you can have more origami paper or if you play with another toy. The options are endless, and I want to explore everything there is. That's one perspective I can think of. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And another perspective being, if i knew the baby for what it is, i would not be able to do it, i would cry. I would comfort the little creature. I would not run the blade through it. Such a beautiful thing. Now if i were to run the blade through her despite knowing it's a baby, then i would be aware that doing so, would reveal that the baby wasn't the baby in the first place, that after it is shred into pieces, there is no baby. The sounds and the cries were emerging out of something which was not the body which was shred, but that which remains an unsolved mystery.

<p>
	Well, you are mixing survival issues with God-realization, which is a bit unfair. You are too wise for your own good! But not wise enough not to hang yourself with your knowledge of enlightenment. So you are stuck in a sort of netherzone.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimate fulfillment is too big of a thing for you to worry about right now. I would leave some room open for enjoying basic survival and getting good at that. It won't all be for waste. It's all part of your growth.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to feed and cloth yourself before you go chasing dreams of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You are right that whatever you do, life is about enjoying the journey, not the destination. This applies to earning a billion dollars as well as to spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	It's too easy to pursue spiritual work joylessly.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget: before enlightenment, the laundry. After enlightenment, the laundry. So you might as well get good at laundry.
</p>

	You don't need a book. Go experience some suffering.
</p>

<p>
	To clarify, your suffering must be mindful to dissolve ego. Mindless suffering can actually increase ego.

	Go do a 30 day solo retreat. You will learn suffering.

<p>
	Well, that's clearly a very unresourceful mindset.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want to spend your whole life thinking like that? Are you happy with the results that mindset brings you?
</p>

<p>
	If not, what results do you want and what mindset would create them?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how your current mindset create a self-fulfilling prophecy? The thing you fear you end up creating by fearing it.
