<p>
	To be technical about it, there is no difference between life being a dream and life being real.
</p>

<p>
	Reality = dream
</p>

<p>
	So you can say the glass is half full or half empty and both are right.
</p>

<p>
	He is just telling you the glass is half full.

<title>sister battling opiod withdrawals, shrooms?</title>

<p>
	Nothing comes close to ibogaine for opioid withdrawal. Ibgaine resets the brain's opioid receptors effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	Tell her to fly to Canada, Mexico, or Costa Rica to an ibogaine clinic.
</p>

<p>
	Ibogaine must be administered by a nurse. You cannot do it at home.

</p>

<p>
	Your desire for art and creativity is selflessness. That is your way of reconnecting with God. That is your church.
</p>

<p>
	Your only problem is your guilt and self-judgment. Let it go and pursue your art guilt-free.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let selfish people gaslight you or make you feel guilty. You fell for the gaslighting.

			I encourage everyone to make a Tinder profil with some regular good looking (top 10%) guy. Just leave the profile text empty, it doesnt matter.

			Its a truly eye opening experiece, within hours you will get hundreds of matches and women will actively contact you. You can say the most braindead/evil/boring stuff and they wont loose interest. Just opening with "Sex?" will get a positive answer. A guy like this can arrange sex with 10+ different girls by putting in 1 hour of half assed effort.

<p>
	This is totally true because online dating is 100% about looks. Nothing else matters.
</p>

<p>
	When you post a pic of yourself online, that's all you're reducing yourself down to.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not a classically handsome guy, this is a terrible strategy for you because you are not displaying your other great qualities. Your strategy must be to get hot girls in-person with your personality, not your looks. Girls respond very differently in-person.
</p>

<p>
	Online is the lazy man's game. If you are lazy with game, don't be surprised when your results look lazy too.
</p>

<p>
	The bulk of a man's attractiveness is in his personality and the life he's built. So to reduce yourself to a profile pic is like selling a diamond at a dollar store.

			Does anyone on here do regular solo camping? Or have experience with bushcraft? If so, can you maintain spiritual practice in the wilderness? Obviously meditation would be easy, but I've always wondered whether it would be possible to do a solo bush retreat, and maintain a Hatha yoga practice. Perhaps I will take this on as my own challenge.

</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice you will be so busy just surviving in the wilderness that you will have very little time for true meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation requires completely detaching from survival. So it's actually easier to do in a well furnished home where most of your survival needs are easily handled. Ideally you'd have someone else even cook your food, so you don't get distracted. Even taking a shit is a distraction.
</p>

<p>
	Notice just how much survival distracts you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you just love camping or want to do it professionally, by all means. But don't confuse that with consciousness work.

	There is.

<p>
	Take a psychedelic with the intention to become conscious of all your projections, assumptions, and judgments. And be ready for a beating.
</p>

<p>
	And while you're at it, become conscious of what "other" is. You may be shocked to discover that other itself is nothing but your projection.

			Why don't these people then distinguish themselves from traditional communism?
		</p>

		<p>
			Even modern facists clearly distinguish themselves from the "nazis" we know from history books
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, they do. The problem is that the audience listening isn't intetested in making such a distinction. Conservatives and centrists like to play dumb because that serves the status quo. It serves Michael Bloomberg to think Bernie is a communist. It serves Jordan Peterson to think that trans activists are in the same category as Stalin and Lenin. Of course this is absurd. But they cannot see it because their careers and realities depend on them not seeing it.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, even Bernie and others like him are not conscious enough to understand what a distinction is. So they don't fully understand that the audience lacks the distinctions they have. Bernie takes his distinctions for granted.
</p>

<p>
	It's one thing to make a distinction, and it's a whole nother thing to know you've made a distinction and that the people you're speaking with haven't made it in their minds. That's some next level stage Yellow and Turquoise shit. Very, very few humans on this planet understand such subtle things. And it's not like you could explain it in a 2 minute CNN segment.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you here still have no idea what a distinction is, and you have been studying this stuff for years.
</p>

	Here's a very basic fact to contemplate:
</p>

<p>
	If these things did not work for some people, they would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is finding out if they work for your particular problem. They may, or may not. It depends on hundreds of factors. And the only way you'll know is by testing it yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Health issues can be very, very complex.

You can feel this inside yourself if you introspect genuinely.
</p>

<p>
	If your keep speaking from a closed mind, don't be surprised if you get banned. You're walking right on the edge. It seems from your POV that you're being intelligent and reasonable, but you are speaking from ignorance. I don't know how else to get you to understand this.
</p>

<p>
	Once again, open your mind. People here are trying to telling you about a radical truth which you have no understanding of yet. It's not personal. You just don't comprehend the depth of what consciousness is because you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you are a dog and we are pointing to the moon and you keep biting the finger. You are missing the moon entirely. But your mind is fooling you into thinking that you know best and that you can rationalize and argue your way out of this problem. You can't. It takes the guidance of an awakened being to show you that you are asleep. But that cannot happen if your mind is closed and you keep insisting that you know best.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside of a dream. And everything your mind says maintains the "reality" of that dream. Your mind will defend, to the death, your dream. Which is what you have been doing this entire thread. But you're not conscious that you're doing it. Either start to wake up or this forum is not for you. This is a waking up forum. Arguing and reasoning will not wake you up. You have yet to realize that.
</p>

<p>
	If you have an emotional reaction to anything said here, just notice that, rather than acting from it. Those emotional reactions are your mind fooling you into staying asleep. You are ideologically attached to the notion of an objective reality because your entire life hinges on it, and yet it is entirely a fiction of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	My words are not something for you to believe or disbelieve, but to investigate. You can validate everything simply by carefully and patiently observing how your own mind works. Waking up is not a function of believing new things. All beliefs are part of the dream your mind creates. So is rationality, logic, science, and religion.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that there is something extremely profound that I am trying to communicate to you right now. But you have to really open your mind first in order to start to get it.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail to get the communication, that's okay. I understand. But you then need to understand that we are not going to waste our time babysitting you and over-explaining things to you here. Our time is better invested in helping those whose minds are open enough to hear the communication.
</p>

<p>
	Old school Soviet style communism of the Leninist stripe is more stage Blue than Green.
</p>

<p>
	Few people have the cognitive frameworks necessary to distinguish the difference between Blue vs Green or old-school communism vs Bernie-style Democratic Socialism.
</p>

<p>
	Even well-educated professors like Jordan Peterson fail to make such distinctions. Because their minds are closed and locked in various paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Very, very few humans think for themselves. Mostly humans just ape other humans.

</p>

<p>
	But 5-MeO-DMT is beyond words.
</p>

<p>
	Shrooms have no limit to their potency. You can eat as much as your stomach can hold and trips forever higher. Your mind will not be able to handle it. So there's no glass ceiling potency-wise. The ceiling is your fragile mind.
</p>

<p>
	Shroom are quite challenging at higher doses. Otherwise psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT are easier because they are clearer. Shrooms can be wacky, twisted, and confusing.
</p>

<p>
	But everyone needs to experience shrooms at least a few times in their life. They have a very magical earthy mystical quality.

<p>
	What info could you expect?
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to let all that shit go and focus on awakening to the fact that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is a radical move.
</p>

<p>
	But it's worth it in the end.

<title>The 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

<p>
	Just want to report, 5-MeO-DMT freebase mixes well with coconut milk for plugging. The milk can reduce the burn. A few drops is all you need.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase also mixes fully in basic cooking vinegar. But vineger will sting your ass more than coconut milk. Still, not bad at all.
</p>

<p>
	You can also experiment mixing freebase in MCT oil. But oil will tend to stick more to any plastic surface like your mixing container, stirring device, and inside of the needless syringe, thus slightly reducing your dose.
</p>

<p>
	Coconut milk is nice in that it isn't sticky like oil.
</p>

<p>
	Coconut milk can also be used to reduce the pain of snorting. But you'd be a fool to snort anything once you master plugging.
</p>

And it is absolutely Absolute.

<p>
	You can be 100% conscious of what everything is. But not through science, relgion, or belief.

	The map is not the territory.

</p>

<p>
	Your body has exactly as much consciousness as a rock. The only difference is, you think you are a body whereas a rock does not think it is a rock.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it doesn't make sense to you is because you assume you were born. This is the key mistake. A rock isn't burdened by such an assumption.
</p>

<p>
	Your birth is imaginary. As a result of imagining your birth, you imagine consciousness belongs to you but not to a rock.
</p>

<p>
	You misunderstand the rock because you misunderstand yourself. And you misunderstand yourself because otherwise you could not be born! Your birth itself is a misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
	People react to 5-MeO-DMT very differently.
</p>

<p>
	In your case I would suggest trying other psychedelics until you find one which suits you and feels good to you. Psychedelics are not supposed to feel like hell every time. They are supposed to feel wonderful. It's important to find the substance which fits you.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe after that you can revisit 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Some chemicals just don't sit right with your body. The body metabolizes chemicals in different ways. Don't assume that all people are the same.

<p>
	Yes, many psychics have told me that I'm an old soul. Not sure if this plays a role, but it might.

<p>
	Government regulates business all the time. Ain't no Constitution gonna stop that.
</p>

<p>
	These naive libertarian arguments are just silly, showing no understanding of how business or government actually works. We don't live in a libertarian fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Having workers on giant corporate boards is crucial for democracy. It is the perfect compromise between capitalism and socialism.

<p>
	The venom contains toxins which need to be burned away in the vaping process.

	Infinity means there is no beginning or end.

<p>
	Ends are impossible.
</p>

<p>
	If you still distinguish between the beginning and end of a thing, you ain't awake.

	Have you considered that your depression is actually a disconnection from being and consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	Your pursuit of sober, practical reality is what makes you depressed, because survival is fundamentally hollow and unsatisfying. You are a hamster in a wheel.

<p>
	Definitely more philosophical.
</p>

<p>
	This is the branch of philosophy known as epistemology. It tries to answer the question: How do we know anything at all?
</p>

<p>
	Psychology doesn't go as deep. But also philosophy tends to do a lot of mental masturbation on this topic.
</p>

<p>
	Learning to accurately distinguish truth from falsehood is the most challenging endeavor the human mind can undertake because it is the linchpin which holds together reality.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully understood it, your entire sense of physical reality would collapse and you would experience "death". So very few people accurate get that far.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to reach Truth via university studies. Truth is far too radical for that.
</p>

<p>
	Some perspectives are deeply false and many are partially true. Few perspectives are all-true.

<p>
	You can't know that ahead of time! That's the point.

<p>
	You are asking for an epistemic foundation. The nature of reality is intimately tied with everything else so it should to be avoided here.
</p>

<p>
	If you admit you don't know, you might be motivated to read some books on capitalism.

<p>
	Yes, it takes work. You want a shortcut. And I am trying to show you that a shortcut here is a mistake. There is no shortcut for learning to distinguish truth from falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of reality is entangled with how you think about reality and with your survival. If these things were seperate, everything would be easy.

</p>

<p>
	But you are asking for a foundation. Do you want a foundating grounded in truth or falsehood? If truth, then your foundation must be not-knowing because that is most true for you. You do not know how to distinguish truth from falsehood. But if you want a foundation grounded in falsehood, then proceed as you were.
</p>

<p>
	I am not speaking of the Absolute here. I am speaking very practically. You do not know how to distinguish truth from falsehood even in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you do not even know if the Earth is flat. This has serious implications in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	I am not even talking about the Absolute here. You are so far from the Absolute that it's nothing but a fantasy for you at this point.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that a lot of epistemic mistakes are made in relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a foundation, it's best that your foundation not be based on falsehood. No one can give you a foundation because how would you know what they gave you is true? A foundation can only be derived by yourself through personal inquiry and contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	The I is everything and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	You can become the floor or the girl, but then "you" as an ego-mind would be dead. And you're terrified of that. So you don't go there unless absolutely forced.
</p>

<p>
	The ego I is just a function of survival. You are too busy surviving to surrender yourself.

<p>
	There cannot be such a thing because reality is groundless and all knowledge is circular, relative, and self-biased.
</p>

<p>
	Any foundation you adopt will be imaginary and itself subject to doubt.
</p>

<p>
	Go foundationless. Practice not-knowing. That will put you closest to Truth.

	The only psychedelic you shouldn't be doing solo is salvia. The rest are mostly handle-able at moderate doses. Of course your results may vary. Some people have poor self-control.

			A quick question I have in mind. So I have been looking into pharmahuasca. Looked into all the foods and meds to avoid prior taking maoi and all the things that could go wrong, all the side effects and stuff. So I've got myself some syrian rue extract, mixed it with at home squeezed grapefruit juice + 150mg syrian rue + 50mg DMT, also prepared a second drink - 100mg syrian rue + 50mg DMT. Before drinking the first drink I consumed around 50 mg syrian rue alone. That was supposedly make the DMT digestion better. Drank the first drink, had a mild nausea, supposedly from the syrian extract, no effects from DMT. Took a second drink - nothing at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			So my question is, what was I doing wrong? Should I try different kind of harmala mixes?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Are you using pure harmala extract? Or actual syrian rue seeds? Make sure your extract is potent. Otherwise you'll need more of it.
</p>

<p>
	Also I've read this technique doesn't always activate. People suggest mixing the DMT with Cola and also eating some carbs like bread or apples immediately after consuming it to help with activation.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful. This combo can make for some long and powerful trips. Start low.
</p>

<p>
	You might also consider plugging the DMT rather than eating it.
</p>

	100mg harmala extract + 50 to 100mg DMT. It should work but must be proven.

<p>
	As I have said, the highest beings in the universe will teach Love and Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	That could be machine elves, angels, aliens, gurus, whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The machine elves are simply telling you about your true nature.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I have not met any non-human/non-animal beings yet. I don't really need to meet them to understand that highest truths because I can access it directly. I don't need an alien to tell me that I am love.
</p>

<p>
	But if you need an alien to tell you that, well, go find your alien.

	The biggest danger is that once he loses the Dem nomination he could run as 3rd party against Sanders, splitting the vote and thereby re-electing Trump.
</p>

<p>
	He probably sees Bernie as worse than Trump, so he will not have any qualms about doing so.

<p>
	Because you are in a state of consciousness which has been tuned for nothing but survival.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is completely irrelevant to survival. So you overlook it.

<p>
	You are Love.
</p>

<p>
	But you aren't conscious of that. But you could become conscious of that if you listened to me rather than try to project egotistical motives on me.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of spiritual teachers are simply not conscious of what Love is. And you are falling into that trap. I pointed that trap out to you, yet you resist taking the trap seriously.
</p>

<p>
	What more can I do? I have told you the highest truth. Get it, or don't. Up to you.
</p>

<p>
	That's your problem right there. You are probably still sexually repressed. Work on that. Something isn't straight there.
</p>

<p>
	Also, take responsibilty for creating your orgasms. Don't act like they are something that happens to you from outside or something the man must do to you. Use your mind to create them. Be more passionate. Don't lay around waiting for someone else to make you passionate. This is a lazy approach to sex.

<p>
	That's one particular model and way to looking at things. There are hundreds of different models. You simply won't have time or the need to learn them all.
</p>

<p>
	The best work is done beyond all models. But if this model helps you, use it.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't expect me to cover every model on my channel. The stuff I'm into now is beyond any human models, science, or even the ability to verbalize. That's just where I'm at.

		</p>

		<p>
			I say it’s very important, it is part of being open minded and really it’s part of living. Life is inherently unknown and mysterious. All our predictions are coming from the past.
		</p>

		<p>
			But the question remains how can we differentiate between calculated risk and risk. We can’t. It’s a duality and there is no clear line.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you’re open minded enough there are no “risks”. In a sense open mindedness takes the “risk” away from risk because then you truly don’t know whether things have gone “bad”. Saying things have gone “bad” is itself a judgement.
		</p>

<p>
	What is the risk here? Quite minimal. It's not like you're being asked to jump out of a plane.
