	Be careful with such high dosages. Dial it back. Anything over 100mg is a lot!

<p>
	All psychedelics can show you that, if you only dare look.

<p>
	ONENESS means there cannot be anything but the Self, and therefore nothing but the Self could have created itself. All is Self-Creation. That is the strange loop. God is that which created itself.

<p>
	Sometimes I will trip with a girlfriend, but that's not for serious, deep work. That's mostly for fun.
</p>

<p>
	The deep work is done solo.
</p>

<p>
	Although psychedelics present some interesting opportunities for deepening intimate relationships and sexuality. But that's its own thing, it's not the core of our work here. And you're not gonna do that in a group setting anyway. That's basically a solo trip for two lovers.

<title>Radical Opinion on Abortion?</title>

<p>
	Notice how this issue involves a struggle to draw a boundary/duality between: alive vs not-alive, conscious vs not-conscious, autonomous vs not-autonomous, part of the mother vs not part of the mother, fully human vs biomass, human vs fly, right vs wrong, moral vs immoral, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The mind wants to ground reality in such boundaries, but all such boundaries are untenable because reality is ONE. Which is why you struggle and struggle to draw those boundaries but will always fail. And why people disagree so much about where the boundaries lie.
</p>

<p>
	There is no point at which a baby is conscious or alive or autonomous or human. There is no point at which a baby is separate from a pine tree. Getting that takes you meta. Learning this lesson is one of the most important things Actualized.org has to teach you. Stop falling into the trap of objectifying dualistic distinctions. If you manage to do that, your mind will be set radically free and peace can come to the world.
</p>

<p>
	Or, continue fighting over imagined dualities.
</p>

<p>
	It was totally expected if you understand LSD dosages.
</p>

<p>
	20ug is almost nothing.
</p>

<p>
	You got exactly what you were supposed to get with a micro-dose.
</p>

<p>
	A solid trip requires 100ug+

Or going into a special center with facilitators and doing that there? I think there are such centers in Amsterdam.

<p>
	I always trip solo. That is the best. But that is my bias, you may have other perferences.

<p>
	Surrounding observers are part of your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	If you put on sunglasses the world doesn't tint for everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness compartmentalizes itself, otherwise things would become a shitshow. How silly would it be if my putting on sunglasses tinted your world? That would spoil the illusion of objective reality. We could code a video game to work that way, but why?
</p>

<p>
	You have to carefully think through the consequences of your imagined scenarios. Life has a very intelligent design. It is not some willy-nilly stuff that some idiot threw together. It is a design of utmost genius that allows for rich experiences like that of humans. This requires some serious design constraints.

<p>
	The flaw in your thinking is not taking into account that your are currently putting enormous energy into imagining exactly your current reality. To enter a new reality you'd have to stop imaging this one.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully imagined a new reality nothing would be left of the current one. That would basically be a totally new life. And then you would still ask, "But why can't I be in some 3rd reality?" You can! But then you lose the 2nd one. You can't be in two realities at once. You have to pick one, which means excluding all others.

			What for? Studies have shown that 80% of the Australian population does not believe it's carbon emissions are linked to climate change. A good 40% believe climate change isn't real.

		<p>
			Australians will keep voting in prime ministers who deny climate change, use sneaky tactics to get out of carbon emission deals with the UN, put environmental protesters in jail for protesting against malicious corporates that are causing climate change, even when these bush fires are happening.
		</p>

		<p>
			Go look at the comments from news.com.au most Australians have a pathological hatred for the greens, labour and the left. The silent majority of Australia hates climate change and believe it's some sort of evil plan by the left to take over the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you donate to the Bush fires, youre donating to people who choose to deny climate change, vote in anti climate change priministers, a surge of people who are strongly against progessive values. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Let Australians burn, we are going to need more then 2000 houses and 20 people killed before they wake up. Watch after these bush fires, everything will be forgotten and the liberal PM will be voted back in. Just like how everyone forgot the black Friday fires.

<p>
	Where is your compassion?
</p>

<p>
	Even if 40% are in denial, that means 60% are not.

<p>
	It's not like these donations will prevent Aussies from waking up. If climate change is real, it will hit them again soon.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like this event already will change a lot of minds. Maybe not those who have career conflicts of interest, but much of the populace who don't.
</p>

<p>
	It won't take too many of these fires to wake Aussies up.

<p>
	Stage Red is not psychopathy. It just appears that way to higher stage people who lack the nuanced understanding of these complex issues.

<p>
	It's all too easy to call dictators and strong-men psychopaths or "crazy" because the mind is looking for a way to dismiss them as so "other" as to be incomprehensible. But that's not the case. Stage Red explains Trump's actions quite well. Study Stage Red more.

<p>
	When we inquire into the existential nature of a thing -- like in this case the notion of reproduction -- we do not limit ourselves by survival concerns. Rather, we go for what is true.
</p>

<p>
	What is reproduction? That is the question. Do not corrupt this question with egoic fears.
</p>

<p>
	If it is true that reproduction is an illusion, then that is what's true! Even if it means the whole human race will die out as a result of knowing it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course it doesn't have to mean that at all. Good luck getting 7 billion people to stop fucking. Even the intelligent ones. Even the enlightened ones still manage to fuck like rabbits.

<p>
	Nothing less will work.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are attached to needing to survive, you are enslaved to falsehood and all your actions will be corrupted by devilry.
</p>

<p>
	This is what is really means to sell your soul to the devil. Your birth was the selling of your soul. Now you are in a struggle to get your soul back.
</p>

<p>
	You sold your soul the day you said, "I am a human."
</p>

<p>
	How does a devil scrub himself of himself?

<p>
	Whatever is True is whatever is True. How it feels is irrelevant. The ego-mind can react to Truth in a thousand different ways. It's safe to say that your ego-mind reacted so much that you never even got a solid look at what Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth makes you upset, you're not solidly conscious of it. You still have a lot of defilements to surrender.

	A deeply religious man who spent his whole life studying the Bible hears a knock on his door.
</p>

<p>
	He asks, "Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
	"It's God. Open up. I have come to show you the way."

<p>
	Because the alternative is often worse.
</p>

<p>
	Commitment just means you're not a selfish child who runs away at the first sign of trouble or something better on the horizon.
</p>

<p>
	It's not different than commitment to a business plan or showing up on time to a meeting. It's hard to create anything worthwhile in life without a commitment. Try executing any major project without a serious commitment. See how far you get.
</p>

<p>
	You couldn't even keep a hamster without a commitment.

<p>
	In practice that's hard to pull off. Public corporations are so competitive that even the CEO could get fired any day if he fails to perform up to expectations.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are always exceptions but most large corporations do not tolerate nepotism these days. Competition is just too fierce to allow such things to fly.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are other problems with hierarchies and domination which have nothing to do with simple nepotism. There is more sophisticated devilry at work within large corporations. The devilry gets extremely sophisticated in order to sneak under the radar.

</p>

<p>
	The reason your examples seem popular is because men's rights groups and conservative groups have waged a PR war against feminism by purposefully strawmanning and demonized it. This is all part of their denial and collective ego backlash against integrating what feminism brings to the table.
</p>

<p>
	Demonization of feminism, progressivism, and socialism is very popular on YT and in right-wing circles. It's a cottage industry. People make entire careers of it -- such as Jordan Peterson. But really his positions are so ignorant that they do not even warrant serious intellectual engagement. It it an insult to a true intellectual to have to defend against such right-wing ignorance.

<p>
	I just don't take such positions seriously. I don't know any serious person who believes or advocates "men are trash" or some such. That's not what feminism is about. A quality feminist understands the value and importance of masculinity and men.
</p>

<p>
	You can find all kinds of nonsense on the internet. That doesn't mean it represents what feminism is about. There are fringe people in every social movement who spout crazy nonsense. To cherrypick those fringe ideas and make them representative of the entire movement is intellectually dishonest and shows a lack of nuance and lack of understanding how movements work.
</p>

<p>
	By your logic we can demonize all of science as long as I can find a few articles written by some fringe scientists about how black people are genetically inferior to white people. But it would be absurd to use such fringe examples as representative of science as a whole.

<p>
	1) The story it tells
</p>

<p>
	2) How it shows up in your consciousness, its being
</p>

<p>
	If you had a thought in a foreign language which you did not understand the sounds would register in your consciousness (that's the actuality or being of a thought) but it would have no meaning/content/story.
</p>

<p>
	速い茶色のキツネが怠zyな犬を飛び越えた
</p>

<p>
	That sentence has being for you but no meaning (unless you know Japanese).
</p>

<p>
	Notice that being is what's primary while meaning is secondary. You can have being without meaning but you cannot have meaning without being.

	Almost no one is saying that. That is your sloppy misunderstanding and strawmanning of feminism.

<p>
	There is a complex interplay between the two.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of people at the top do deserve to be there because they are exceptionally skilled, talented, experienced, and hard working. But there are many exceptions such as Trump.
</p>

<p>
	In a modern corporation you will not rise to the top unless you are exceptionally good at your job. But even so, that doesn't justify the exploitation of those below you.

<p>
	Of course Iran is less developed on the Spiral than the US and Iran has a collective ego and does behave in devilish ways.

<p>
	But even so, while Trump threatens Iranian cultural sites Iran is conscious enough to explicitly say they will not target US civilians.

<p>
	So far Iran has the moral high ground.

<p>
	No, men are not being oppressed. The ego just perceives equalizing as oppression because a self-biased mind doesn't see a difference.
</p>

<p>
	If you owned slaves 200 years ago your ego-mind would perceive abolition as unfair and oppressive. Because it is from the POV of a slave owner. The slave owner feels fully entitled to own slaves. To take way his slaves would appear to him as robbery or debasement of the natural order.
</p>

<p>
	Equality is a radical thing. It means the ego has to surrender what it has taken for granted as its own.
</p>

<p>
	It is a projection of a low consciousness mind that if it gives up domination it will be dominated by those who complained about being dominated by it. The key is to realize that those you dominated may not be interested in dominating you back, they just want a non-dominating dynamic on all sides.

	Women had less rights because for the majority of mankind's evolution the state of consciousness was so low that physical force determined rights and power hierarchies. Survival was unbelievably brutal and physical. The strongest dominated the weakest and established "rights" and rules which served them.
</p>

<p>
	But now we are starting to move away from brutal animalistic survival and now the physical strength difference between men and women is becoming less and less important.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a matter of men deciding to give women rights, but rather the entire species is evolving in consciousness and society is developing hard and soft infrastructure which allows for non-violent means of existence. This is not a process anyone controls. Men do not control it. Both men and women are puppets of larger evolutionary forces which drive the entire universe towards greater consciousness and love. Those who are physically weaker are treated with more compassion. This is true not just of women but children, the sick, the disabled, the mentally ill, animals, the environment, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are conscious enough it is no longer tenable to dominate others even if you happen to be physically bigger or stronger than them. It hurts your own consciousness to do so. Ego is slowly realizing the existential equality of all beings by looking past the material differences -- which are not fundamentally important.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than seeing all this as a fight for rights, see it as an expansion of consciousness, love, and self-identity.
</p>

<p>
	If you were highly conscious and had high Self-Love, you would not have a desire to dominate anyone, even if it gave you some temporary material gain. The material gain is inferior to Selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	Love is EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what feeling you have or choice you make. That is the point. The ego sets conditions on love to suit its survival because it's biased. But love is not limited to that. Love is unlimited, infinite, and unconditional. Whether you understand that is another matter.

These are separate issues. An enlightened boomer can have shitty outdated politics. In fact, I would bet on it.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened people can still be closedminded to things. They can still cling to false beliefs about the relative world. And they certainly still have biases of which they are not aware.

	Not at all.

<p>
	Philosophy classes in universities are as conformist and unoriginal as Sunday School.
</p>

<p>
	All of Harvard is a conformist nest. Little orginal thinking happens there.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse such things for truth-seeking or thinking. They are playing academic survival games. Nobody at Harvard understands what reality is or how consciousness works.

<p>
	No actual philosophy is done in a philosophy classroom. That would be far too dangerous to be allowed.

	Tucker Carlson don't give a fuck about foreign people. They are like animals from his level of consciousness. He cares about building up an American identity. All of his politics revolves around that, as does everyone's at Fox News. That is the function of Fox News: to build and defend an American collective ego.

	1) How many times did this happen exactly? Two times? That doesn't necessarily mean anything. Could just be a fluke. Although it is a bit odd.
</p>

<p>
	2) Learn to provide amazing sex and girls will be begging you to go exclusive with them. Seems like your sex is missing the dominance and newness components. For sex to be good, you have to find ways to keep it new. Don't be doing the exact same routine every time. Fuck her in the restaurant bathroom once in a while. Etc. Get creative. Dominance is also important. Drive up the masculine/feminine polarity. Make her feel feminine so she is satisfied.
</p>

<p>
	You can also up your value as a man. As you become more successful, more confident, more humorous, more wise, more healthy, etc. all this will massively attract her to you. She should see you as a one-of-a-kind catch. She should feel like she won the lottery in dating you.

<p>
	India simply lacks basic high-quality governmental infrastructure to sustain peace between all those tribes: court systems, roads, uncorrupted police, bridges, toilets, parks, meat inspections, etc. All of that must be built up before Stage Green can emerge in a significant way.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be Stage Green if 200 million people are still wiping their ass with their bare hands like they did 5,000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	The function of government is to solve such logistical challenges. By solving such challenges egos are pacified and there can be talk of higher consciousness values. Otherwise people behave like animals.

<p>
	That is the point of automation. That is why automation is a very good and important trend. Automation frees up mankind to pursue their passions without needing to do grunt work. Most people simply don't understand this yet because living a passionate life is scary -- it takes a lot more responsibility and consciousness.

<p>
	No, it's not conscious. It's a lack of consciousness. It's self-bias, closemindedness, ego, and just how Stage Blue cognition works.
</p>

<p>
	He is genuine in his beliefs. Basically all people are genuine in their ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	From Ben Shaprio's POV, he's helping the world be a better place, he's acting from love -- like all people. But since his self-awareness is quite low, his love ends up being very selfish and partial. It's not really his fault. All evil is simply lack of consciousness. Which is why evil doesn't really exist. It is just misdirected love.

<p>
	Here you must distinguish between the intelligence required to think within the box of society vs the intelligence of truly original thinking.
</p>

<p>
	To earn a law degree you don't need to do any original thinking, you just need to be very good at following the rules and orders that society has laid out for you. You need to be a good soldier. Which is what Stage Blue excels at. Stage Blue is great at being meticulously conformist. If you need to hire someone to make sure that concentration camps operate like well-oiled machines, you hire a nice conformist boy like Ben Shaprio to manage it for you. He will do it without asking any questions. This was in fact how Nazi Germany was run.

<p>
	Nothing strange about it. Every political position can be criticized from above or below, not just left vs right. You can be anti-interventionist from above or below. For example, you could believe that it's wrong to start a war in the Middle East because they are low-life savages who don't even deserve to fight the noble white man. But such anti-interventionism is further from Stage Green anti-interventionism than wanting to invade the Middle East to steal their oil. One would first have to evolve in consciousness just to see the Middle East as a worthwhile place to steal oil from, and only then one might evolve further in consciousness to actually care about the lives and interests of Middle Easterners as much as white lives and interests.
</p>

<p>
	You can be opposed to war for the wrong reasons. What matters most is not the fact that you oppose war, but what level of consciousness you're seeing the situation from. You might oppose war because you're to fearful of getting drafted. But that is a selfish perspective which is very different from opposing war because you're conscious of the suffering it would cause the "enemy".
</p>

<p>
	The true problem with the Middle East wars is not that it hurts America's interests, but that it creates suffering for innocent and powerless people in the Middle East. It's like kicking a wounded dog and blaming the dog.
</p>

<p>
	If every human took a shit in the same room, we'd all be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing material scales infinitely. Everything has to be in proportion in a complex society.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake in your logic is that you assume that following your passion means that this should scale across 7 billion people. But of course it won't, simply because 95% won't ever even hear the advice, let alone follow it, so it's not something to worry about.
</p>

<p>
	Following your passion is advice aimed at 5% of the population. And that is workable. And by the time 5% of the population is following their passion, that will open the doors for another 5% to do the same, and so on, until one day we can have 50%+ people doing it, and maybe some day 90%+. But this will take many generations.

	You can be a musician precisely because most people have no interest in being musicians because they are not wired like you. Probably less than 1% of people in the world would choose to be a musician if they have total freedom to do whatever they wanted.
</p>

<p>
	For example, human civilization would collapse if everyone became enlightened overnight. Which is precisely why it will never happen. Enlightenment is very rare precisely because it needs to be rare in order for civilization to sustain itself. But this is irrelevant if you are the one who knows awakening is your thing.

<p>
	This applies all the way up and down the chain of life.
</p>

<p>
	If a Unified World Government seems unlikely or impractical, just remember that 2000 years ago the idea of a country was crazy because there were only walled city-states. And 2 billion years ago, the idea of multicellular organisms was crazy because there were only single-celled organisms eating each other.
</p>

<p>
	For a human body to exist, single-celled organisms had to learn to cooperate with each other despite having their own selfish agendas.
</p>

<p>
	This is a game that life has played out for 2 billion years.

	He was a regional war hero, akin to George Washington.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how Americans would react if George Washington was assassinated by Iran. That is the situation here. Even the most moderate Iranians will now be pissed off and driven to violence because this is a matter of pride and self-respect. No self-respecting nation can allow such abuse.
</p>

<p>
	When Iranian history books are written, Soleimani will go down as their George Washington, and now a martyr at the hands of an evil empire. A generation of children will grow up hating America.
</p>

<p>
	Killing him was the worst possible strategic blunder from America's POV. Iran is now united and empassioned.

	Every US general and secretary of defense is a war criminal by the US's own logic.
</p>

<p>
	Of course top military leaders mastermine the deaths of thousands of people. That is their job.
</p>

<p>
	By the US's own logic, all top US officials are justified to be assassinated for their military planning. That's how absurdly self-biased the position is.

	Stop listening to him period. His intellect is just garbage.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who takes the likes of him or Tucker Carlson seriously is just a joke. You cannot take anything they say seriously because it is so stunningly self-biased and intectually bankrupt.
</p>

<p>
	Some people are so banrkupt that even to listen to them or engage with them seriously is already a mistake. This pretty much goes for anyone at Fox News. It's self-biased propaganda.

<p>

<p>
	It's a small factor but nothing worth worrying about.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, reverse racism is just racism. Racism doesn't only apply to white people. Anyone can be racist.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use the notion of reverse racism to argue that nothing needs to be done about racism or that racism doesn't exist. Which is just hogwash.

<p>
	That's your strawman of what they say. They never actually say 90%. More like 25%. Which is about right.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they demonize the right too much sometimes. How else could Green be?
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a serious issue which the country has not yet fully addressed. There's a lot of denial going around about it still. People like to think they are more developed than they actually are.

<p>
	Your issue is more basic than meditation. Meditation is not going to fix your neediness because you're not at a level of development yet where you can even take meditation seriously.
</p>

<p>
	The advice for you is: work on your isolation, learn to socialize, build social skills, develop friends, develop dating skills, have sex, and THEN meditation will help you reach higher levels.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is not a shortcut for avoiding learning basic survival skills like dating, making money, proper diet, etc. Meditation is a rather advanced skill for people who have already become proficient at survival and want to reach the next level.
</p>

<p>
	Once you've had a bunch of sex and made a bunch of money, then you ask, "Okay, what's next?" That's where meditation starts to look appealing.

<p>
	Don't assume that. Most people here don't meditate or meditate so ineffectively that they might as well be watching TV.
</p>

<p>
	Serious meditation is a rare skill that very few people practice.
</p>

<p>
	And meditation takes years to pay off.

<p>
	If you put a stage Orange person in a Green environment, they are likely to not fit in and have falling out. Which is what happened.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not so simplistic as to say that if you put an Orange person into a higher environment he will automatically grow into it. Many people will have a backlash and entrench themselves in their old stage.
</p>

<p>
	If TYT hired a white supremacist, he would probably quit in short order and start his own white supremacy YT channel.

<p>
	I think it describes his behavior very well.
</p>

<p>
	Since a solid Orange person is very much driven by personal success and profit, it makes a lot of sense that Rubin would dump TYT and its values to start his own show and make a big name for himself speaking out against liberals as a gay dude.
</p>

<p>
	It seems that Rubin's work at TYT was not based on deeply held Green values but a desire to make it in online media. Which is a very Orange thing. And that's exactly why he didn't fit in there and why he's doing his current show.
</p>

<p>
	He wasn't developed enough to last at TYT.
</p>

<p>
	This is easily evidenced by his last of understanding of Green values and his libertarianism.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow? Ha!
</p>

<p>
	He's stuck in Orange with a big Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	He didn't see the limits of Green. Just as he started getting exposed to Green he couldn't handle it and doubled-down on Orange.
</p>

<p>
	He is criticizing Green from below, not above.

	JP carefully avoids serious discussions of policy. He's focused on culture wars to distract from real issues like corporate corruption, environmental destruction, military-industrial complex, gross income inequality, gerrymandering, voter suppression, suppression of unions, anti-trust violations, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Because in his world these are not important issues. His world revolves around silly happenings on college campuses. You can't make a good career out of talking about serous policy issues. It's much easier to make a career out of being a cultural warrior who wages a lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental conservative position is that things are basically fine if we just return to the way things were and stop rocking the boat with progressive ideas. The need for structural reform isn't evident to them because they are busy defending the system to which they have hitched their identity.
</p>

<p>
	A Christian doesn't see a need to reform Christianity, he sees the evils of Islam instead.
</p>

<p>
	A scientists doesn't see a need to reform science, he sees the evils of religion instead.
</p>

<p>
	A democrat doesn't see a need to reform the democrat party, he sees the evils of republicans instead.
</p>

<p>
	This is classic self-deception: create a distraction by projecting the problem outward at some scapegoat. Meanwhile, no deep self-reflection is done and no real internal structure change is made -- which his exactly what the ego wants.
</p>

<p>
	JP doesn't want to seriously investigate the structural limitations of capitalism. So he scapegoats liberals as Neo-Marxists which creates a loud flashy sideshow that draws in a crowd of mouth-breathers who also have no interest in a deep analysis of capitalism. As that would actually require some mental and emotional labor. It would be scary and unsettling to admit that maybe you are part of a corrupt and mindless capitalist regime that perpetuates the needless suffering of millions. Especially if that regime earns you good money and feeds your children.

<p>
	Of course, otherwise it would have been resolved a thousand years ago. These are profound existential challenges of a cosmic order requiring millions of deaths to understand and transcend. This is life and death stuff we're dealing with. It doesn't get any more serious than this.
</p>

<p>
	And yet ironically it's all a joke in the end.
</p>

<p>
	We (God) are stuck in an existential bind of infinite proportion.

	Suffering sits deeper than belief.
</p>

<p>
	When the suffering gets strong enough, all your pretty beliefs will fly out the window. Then only consciousness can prevail. And even that will flag and wane for most people. Only training of consciousness can overcome that.

			Who cares if the suffering is imaginary when it feels real and causes me all this pain?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The point is precisely that if you were conscious that suffering is imaginary, it would stop being painful.
</p>

<p>
	But you're not conscious of that, so it is still painful for you.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between believing that suffering is imaginary vs actually being conscious of it at the moment of the torture. This work is not done at the level of belief.
</p>

<p>
	So you're right in that there is no point in believing that reality is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	But you're wrong in that that's not what I'm suggesting you to do. I'm suggesting you to become CONSCIOUS of it. Which is a totally different thing. You are not anywhere near being conscious of it yet. This seems like a word game because for you it IS only a word game. But I am telling you there is something beyond the word game which you are not yet aware of. If you ever go beyond the word game, that's where you'll feel the difference.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming so conscious that you can no longer be physically killed. That's what we're talking about here. Obviously this cannot happen as a matter of belief. You must actually become physically unkillable. How is such a thing possible? Well, if you knew how, you'd already be immortal. So of course it won't make much sense from your current vantage point. You have to be willing to go radically outside the box of what you consider reality to be.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that your ego will try to keep all of these teachings safely at the level of word games. Because then the ego is never threatened. The challenge in this work is to make sure you're actually doing the work, not just thinking about it. Thinking about doing the work is not the same as doing the work. Talking about enlightenment is not enlightenment. Thinking about reality being an illusion is not the same as experiencing it as such in every moment.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between talking about having a million dollars vs actually having one million in cash in your closet.
</p>

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You are confusing two things: truth and what your ego wants. Spirituality in its purest form means more truth, whatever that entails. It might entail an early death (as in the case of Jesus) or a long life (as in the case of The Buddha). But truth is truth regardless of its consequences on the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not that spirituality ultimately leads to less stability, the opposite is the case if you do it right. The problem is that there are many traps, many ways to screw it up along the way. And even if you tell people about all the traps, they will still not listen and fall into them.

	But also don't forget the many dangers of not doing this work. It's not as though your life will go smoothly if you avoid this work. The opposite is the case.

	I didn't particularly list my stages in order.
</p>

<p>
	They can happen in any order -- whichever resonates with you.

	Buckle in, because your work has only just begun. You are like at page 2 of a 10,000 page book thinking you're close to the end.
</p>

<p>
	The work is far deeper than it is ever possible to communicate.

			Then by the end of april I lost myself (the higher self I had worked so hard to bring into my life) because I was ungrateful for what I became . I cried one night when I realized I lost everything i ever knew i was, all these 28 years and i couldn't recognize myself. I did alot of awareness work and used l-theanine daily. And used 600-700 lsd every fortnight. Now Its like I'm at the beginning again but even worse. I literally feel like I'm in an abys.

<p>
	Seems like you're taking too much too fast and have more basic personal development work to do.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is fine, just pace yourself better.
</p>

<title>Leo's Work Is Becoming Dangerous</title>

<p>
	The topics we deal with here are inherently dangerous and could not be otherwise since they involve undoing and transcending survival.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is very dangerous to the ego-mind. These dangers are not merely perceptual, they are also "actual", in the sense of physical danger. You can't do serious spiritual work and also complain, "But this can be dangerous". Of course! If it wasn't dangerous it wouldn't be worth doing. The whole point is that its dangerous and therefore rarely done well.
</p>

<p>
	This works requires enormous nuance, care, and intelligence. These are structural meta-qualities which cannot ever be codified in the form of content. Which means, no matter how many times a teacher says to be nuanced, careful, and intelligent, it will not help someone who is sloppy, careless, and ignorant. You cannot make a person intelligent by telling them to be intelligent. If things were so easy we wouldn't be here struggling with consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The danger of the work is exactly what makes it so appealing. There are stakes. Much like life. Otherwise it would just be armchair philosophy with no transformative power. Changing your life comes at a cost. You might change it for the worse.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, set priorities and pace things out in stages. If you pace things well, then yes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to think 10 years ahead.
</p>

<p>
	But if you just randomly try to do multiple things at once you'll probably not get anywhere on either front.
</p>

<p>
	Mastering a career or art takes so much work, dedication, and attention that you need to have a clear, singular vision for what you're trying to achieve. Then hit it every day for 5-10 years relentlessly.
</p>

<p>
	This is discussed in detail in my Life Purpose Course.
