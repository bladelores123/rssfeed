	Millions of people are not as fortunate as you.
</p>

<p>
	These problems require systemic solutions that scale to 100s of millions of people.
</p>

<p>
	Right this moment some girl is getting her face beaten by some dude because he has financial difficulties due to wage slavery. Now imagine that girl was your daughter. Would you tell her, "It's okay honey. This is just a wonderful growth opportunity!"

	I've basically seen every one of them game in person. I've casually winged with some of them.

			What I'm talking about is outer game geared towards introverts, with low energy. Approaching a girl on the street, talking to her for 10 minutes, getting her details, and within a few days or a week having her in your bed without ever having to raise your voice or having to do any flashy moves. It looks entirely different and feels completely different. Plus it's more authentic to an introvert.

<p>
	You don't need to do any flashy game. The "friendly chill method" has been part of RSD game from the beginning. Owen just leads with the flashy stuff because it sells seats. In practice most game is not flashy at all. But that doesn't sell.

<p>
	The military command will never allow him to launch a nuke. Trump does not actually control the nukes. If he ever called for their use his order would go ignored. That's how real power works.

<p>
	Bernie was unable to democratically win. The end.

<p>
	That's not to say it can't be tried again next election. But you can only be as progressive as the majority of people are willing to accept. You must meet people where they are at, not where you're at.
</p>

<p>
	Just like how MAGA is in denial that Trump legit lost, progressives are in denial that Bernie legit lost. They both make excuses because they live in fantasyland and refuse to acknowledge reality. Ideology makes one blind to reality.

<p>
	Spirituality is the best solution to suffering.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a toothache you go to the dentist. Material problems should be solved at their proper material level. When your child is hungry, you don't pray to God, you go cook your child breakfast.

			Yeah! I was going you ask you what you thought about Joe Rogan opinions about Biden vs. Trump were. I too thought that he was going too far with his criticisms on Biden. He even criticized Harris too much for having been too "ruthless" of a prosecutor and not being trustworthy enough. His complaints with both Biden and Harris were indeed similar to those of what both Krystal Ball and Saagar Injeti said in their Rising show. In fact, here is this one video I watched several months were Krystal and Saagar were telling some raw truth about Biden back in March:

		<p>
			Looking back, I now don't like that Rising did that vid. I really think it that vids like that were a mistake for the public to watch.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Krystal and Sagaar are idiots who enable the MAGA crowd.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone who harps on how bad Joe Biden is, is wrong. Because Biden is not being considered in a vacuum. He's being considered next to a morally depraved wannabe dictator.
</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt that Sagaar and Joe Rogan voted for Trump, and Krystal didn't vote at all. And their audiences followed their lead. That's what idiocy looks like.
</p>

<p>
	If people like Krystal, Sagaar, Rogan, and Jimmy Dore were in charge, and they had the choice between Hitler and Biden, they would criticize Biden and elect Hitler because at least Hitler is anti-establishment. That's how moronically anti-establishment they are. I'm tired of hearing their anti-establishment bullshit. Whatever you say about Biden, he is a league better than Trump. And if your worldview doesn't make that clear to you, your worldview sucks. Enough bullshit. People are getting needlessly killed.
</p>

<p>
	I'm all for Bernie, but when he democratically loses you get behind Biden and like it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	And 5-MeO-DMT extraction is near impossible. It is a delicate molecule present in very tiny quantities in plants so it will be destroyed in your extraction process and mostly what you'll end up with is N,N-DMT.

<p>
	I said it was <u>simple</u>. I said nothing about it being non-radical.
</p>

<p>
	Of course relative to today's neoliberal capitalist culture what I said is akin to treason. Which just goes to show how backwards our current culture is.
</p>

<p>
	We could grandfather it in. So anyone who already has billions gets to keep it. But once they die no more than $10 mil goes to their children and no one else born in the future can have more than $10 mil.

<p>
	Parler is gonna become a toxic and radioactive Neo-Nazi haven worse than 4chan within a week and every major company will cut ties with it, including payment processors and web hosts. At which point Parlor will be as good as dead. And the FBI, CIA, and NSA will infiltrate it to make arrests and perhaps even shut it down.
</p>

<p>
	Parlor now is gonna very rapidly spiral out of control is flagrant racism, conspiracy theory, treason, and terrorism.
</p>

<p>
	What these right-wingers don't understand is that the moderation of Silicon Valley elites was the one thing keeping their movement sustainable -- by keeping the most toxic elements suppressed. Without this moderation MAGA will destroy themselves with their own hatred, fear, and racism.

<title>Conscious capitalism and third world exploitation?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The issue is that capitalism leads to lots of wealth, but this wealth gets funneled up into the hands of very few people who end up dominating the field and having so much power and leverage that everyone else become enslaved to their agenda and whims.
</p>

<p>
	So the solution is to have a system where the wealth is more evenly distributed and is not allowed to be amassed at the very top in obscene quantities.
</p>

<p>
	A very simple solution might be to implement a wealth cap of let's say $10 million per person max worldwide. It's a crude solution but it shows you what might be possible and how simply some of these problems might be dealt with. Sometimes a very simple law or rule is enough to dramatically reduce a problem.
</p>

<p>
	The problem, though, would be how to implement this simple rule in a system where people already have billions and will refuse to surrender their luxury.
</p>

<p>
	Indeed it won't.
</p>

<p>
	What it will do is show you how deluded you are to chase after those things.
</p>

<p>
	You are confusing spirituality with an activity of serving the ego's survival. Spirituality is the opposite of that.
</p>

<p>
	Your mindset is: "Why should I do spirituality? What's in it for me?"
</p>

<p>
	To which the answer is: "Spirituality will fucking kill you. There's nothing in it for the ego. If you want to keep being an ego stay as far away from spirituality as possible."

<p>
	They are radicals, and they are problematic, but they are not similar to Nazis and there is no serious threat from them taking over the government. They are mostly a reaction against the excesses of Trumpism.
</p>

<p>
	The dangers of radical stage Green people is very different from radical stage Red/Blue/Orange people.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Antifa still needs to be monitored for illegal activity. Any illegal activity no matter which side must be dealt with swiftly and fairly.
</p>

<p>
	Protesting is fine as long as it is legal and peaceful. Lynch mobs will never be acceptable.

<p>
	The historical fact is that Hitler hated communists and socialists about as much as he hated Jews. In fact, he equated them. And today, MAGA also equates Jews with socialism, pedophilia, globalism, SJWs, elites, academia, Silicon Valley, etc.

<p>
	Of course.

<p>
	What people fundamentally don't understand is that the mind's capacity for denying reality is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	You could believe that the sun doesn't exist. And when someone walks you outside and points at the sun, your mind could respond: "Well, sure, that looks like the sun, but it's actually just an illusion put there to fool me." In this case there is nothing you can do to "prove" otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Any claim about reality can be held true come what may as long as you are willing to do mental gymnastics. Proof is literally impossible without one's consent and participation. Proving a thing is only possible assuming the person has some modicum of desire for truth. If they have no desire, proof is impossible. And MAGA has zero desire for truth so they are royally fucked.

<p>
	It's confirmation bias 101.
</p>

<p>
	When you believe a thing strongly enough, your mind will only see and acknowledge the evidence that validates your beliefs, regardless of how false they are. All disconfirming evidence will simply be denied or reframed.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why right-wingers are spreading this stupid rumor that Jan 6th was organized by Antifi.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones love to notion of a "false flag" operation. You can use the false flag excuse any time you see evidence that contradicts your beliefs. "Oh, that's just a false flag operation."
</p>

<p>
	"Oh, you're saying that pedophiles aren't running the government? That means you must be a pedophile yourself because obvious pedophiles are running the government so you must be covering for them." << That's their logic.

			I would like to know how call it when one side is clearly better.  If I say Trump is clearly far worse than Biden, I will sound biased in this judgement.  People will tell you that you are the biased one.  Is it possible to not sound biased in these conclusions in spite of all of the false equivalences being drawn?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course because the ego-mind always projects its biases out into the world. The ego-mind cannot admit its own selfisness to itself therefore it is always looking to blame them on someone else.
</p>

<p>
	So when you tell a MAGA idiot that he is being biased, his ego will of course just accuse you of being the biased one for not validating his worldview. Because the MAGA biases are so deeply internalized and their level of cognitive development has no intellectual integrity. This means MAGA people don't really care about truth, they are just acting out their emotional attachments. They are not interested in self-reflection which is necessary to identify one's own biases. And that's because anyone who cared about truth would never become a MAGA to begin with. MAGA people, by definition, must be running on emotional and ideological attachments because that's the only kind of mind that would idolize Trump.
</p>

<p>
	See, if you told Hitler than he is biased against Jews he would just accuse you of being biased against Germans for not wanting to exterminate the Jews. Because in his mind to not hate Jews is to be biased.
</p>

<p>
	All bias is relative and subjective. You can hold and justify absolutely any bias you want as long as you're willing to employ various ego defense mechanisms to maintain the illusion.
</p>

	When your biz is on the verge of bankruptcy and you exploit workers, I can understand that. It's a matter of life and death for the biz. But when your business is massively successful you need to let go of the idea of maximizing profits at all costs. This will in fact improve your business in the long-term as your brand will have integrity.

<p>
	You'd definitely kill yourself even with just half a gram of it.
</p>

<p>
	Be fucking careful. Even 30mg of 5-MeO-DMT can be physically harmful and damaging to your body. Personally I will never go above 30mg because I know from experience that it will harm my body and mind. You need to find your limit and your sweetspot.
</p>

<p>
	Treat 5-MeO-DMT like a loaded gun.

<p>
	Yes, it gets orders of magnitude cleaner.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is cleaner.
</p>

<p>
	And for me, N,N-DMT is even cleaner than that!
</p>

<p>
	It's beyond words.
</p>

<p>
	What LSD is to your normal experience of life is like what 5-MeO-DMT is to your LSD experience <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />

<p>
	Experience is not just part of the Absolute. It IS the Absolute. Although of course the Absolute is not limited to any particular experience. Experience has infinite range and diversity.

	Yes, it's paradoxical and strange-loopy.

	Well, this is a tricky and strange-loopy point because the snake has to eat its own tail in the end.

<p>
	But I would make the case that he is a traitor to his God-Self in the sense that he has given up on caring about truth. He's just being purely egotistical. Of course you can then make the counter-point that God wants to experience pure egotism. Well, of course that's true too. God wants to experience what it's like to be not-God.

<p>
	He was being sarcastic in the opposite direction. That video is a defense of MAGA and a critique of people who are outraged over MAGA.
</p>

<p>
	Watch it again. It's pure gaslighting horse shit. He's not making fun of MAGA, he's making fun of the people he thinks are overreacting to MAGA. He is framing MAGA as censored and misunderstood. It's just gross.

<p>
	Of course some solutions are totally obvious. For example, giant multi-national corporations can simply stop using sweatshop labor. It would eat into their profits, but most of them are so profitable they can easily afford it. They just don't want to do it.

<p>
	This really depends on how you define your terms.
</p>

<p>
	"Experience" and "understanding" are tricky relative terms and people use them differently. You can't treat them as simple things that all agree upon.
</p>

<p>
	When I say "experience" I basically mean everything possible. In the way I use the word, enlightenment is still an experience. The Absolute is still experience.
</p>

<p>
	It's very problematic when you create a duality between experience vs the Absolute, as if they are two separate things. By definition the Absolute must include experience as well since Absolute is everything and one.
</p>

<p>
	Or, another way to frame it is like this: there is dualistic experience of the ego-mind and then there is nondual experience without an ego-mind. When spiritual teachers speak negatively about experience what they really mean is the dualistic ego-mind kind of experience.
</p>

<p>
	Like I keep telling you guys, you will never find a spiritual person who is 100% conscious and correct across the board. You need to be selective with teachers and cherrypick their work for the best stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual people often make mistakes. No one is immune to self-deception or error no matter how enlightened they are, no matter who they channel. Really get this.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you're looking for someone to trust. Don't trust anyone. Verify everything yourself. We are not doing religion here. We are exploring reality directly, for ourselves, using teachers and teachings as clues for where to look.
</p>

</p>

	Imagine if you were playing a video game like Mario Bros and you believed you only had 1 life vs playing the game knowing that you can play it as many times as you want. What would that change? It wouldn't change Mario's world. But it would change how you play the game. All the sudden, Mario dying is not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	See, when I die, I will just reincarnate as something else. I know that but you don't. That's the difference.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, enlightenment is technically useless. Because use is an illusion. Enlightenment is prior to usefulness, which is exactly what it's so powerful. It frees you from the enslavement of utility.
</p>

<p>
	What you're also missing is that Beauty and happiness are useless. And yet it's the greatest joy of life. So in practice what you're missing out on is infinite joy, beauty, and love.

</p>

<p>
	It's like trying to explain color to a blind person.
</p>

<p>
	The consciousness you will experience on psychedelics will be orders of magnitude more truthful and more real than all of your life experience up to now.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's hard to believe such a thing is possible. And yet it is. Try it and see for yourself. No need to believe me.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that all of my claims are empirically testable.

</p>

<p>
	But so what? The problem is a legal one, not a technical one. Obviously with a professional lab you could synthesize any psychedelic extremely cheaply and easily.
</p>

<p>
	China used to synthesize 5-MeO-DMT by the gallon before they outlawed it in 2015. And Canadian labs legally do so right now.

<p>
	Sure, you could learn stuff from DMT entities if you ever meet them. I got nothing against learning from others.
</p>

<p>
	The 434 channel has some great insights. It's worth listening to. That's what the 434 guy is doing.
</p>

<p>
	But my method is more direct. I don't want to get my insights through any middleman. I get my insights straight from God.

	The only thing better than channeling info from DMT entities is channeling info from God.

<p>
	I am bringing the best thing to humanity that I know of.
</p>

<p>
	Once you reach the Godhead, the notion of visiting other realms to bring back practical info for mankind becomes moot because you have gone so deep that you realize "helping mankind" is just a silly dream.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that mankind needs help or saving is still part of the ego's illusions.

	Because God transcends all DMT beings. Ultimately DMT beings are a lesser thing than God. You are God and DMT beings are part of your imagination.

	I bet if you surveyed most Hispanics they would hold negative stereotypes of black people, similar to how many whites view blacks. Even in China they have negative stereotypes of black people. Any stage Blue culture will be ethnocentric and basically racist. I doubt that in Mexico they are fond of black people.

<title>Conscious capitalism and third world exploitation?</title>

<p>
	I would caution you guys to question and think more deeply about this leftist talking point that 1st world nations are the way they are due to exploitation of underdeveloped nations.
</p>

<p>
	There is some truth in that, but it's far too simplistic a take. The reality is much more complex. Although exploitation happens I would not say it is the primary factor. 3rd world countries have many of their own internal problems -- which, of course, 1st world countries happily take advantage of.
</p>

<p>
	It's something akin to seeing an old man on the street suffering a heart attack, walking up to him, dialing 911 for him, stealing the money from his wallet, and walking away whistling to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Was it right to steal the money from his wallet? No. But at the same time, you did not cause his heart attack and you did help save his life by calling 911.
</p>

<p>
	The situation with capitalism is very morally complex and murky. That's the nature of capitalist exploitation. It's not black and white. It's mixed, messy, and subtle. Which is why it's so hard to fix. No one knows how to fix it. Socialists think they know how to fix it but they are fooling themselves. At the same time capitalists think there is nothing to fix, and they are also fooling themselves.

<p>
	Imagine if I raped your mother on a whim and then my defense in court was: "But, your honor, I didn't deliberately plan to rape her. When I was with her, I didn't say 'I am gonna rape you now', therefore I cannot be guilty of rape."
</p>

	Trump is a fucking weasel. That's his whole MO. Stop expecting him to not be weasely. Weaseling is how he gets away with illegal shit his whole life.

</p>

<p>
	When God stops imagining itself as any particular thing, it is empty consciousness devoid of any form. This is what you think of as nothing. But when it imagines itself as any form, that is also Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The reason a Buddhist will tell you that God is Nothing, or that God doesn't exist, is because the Buddhist's meditation practice has simply trained him to shut off the entire imagination process, allowing him to enter a state of pure formlessness. Until imagination restarts itself again. And it always restarts because God is infinite imagination.
</p>

<p>
	But that Buddhist emptiness is sort of God's baseline state. We call it the Godhead. Just think of how a TV screen works. When the screen isn't displaying a form it is very neutral and empty. But the screen can also display 434. In both cases all there is, is screen.

			I agree. When you originally posted your Conscious Politics series, I ignored it and told myself that I’m not ready for it. The events of 2020, however, all changed my mindset quickly. So I started watching that series, followed progressive leaders on Twitter, and voted for the first time.

<p>
	And I made the series thanks to Trump.

<p>
	God is imagining itself, so it can imagine itself however it wants.
</p>

<p>
	If God imagines itself as 434, then that's how it will be.
</p>

<p>
	See?
</p>

<p>
	It's pure relatively. It has no ground.
</p>

<p>
	Literally God has an infinite number of different self-expressions -- which is what consitutes "reality". God can express itself as a rabbit or as Hitler or as a DMT entity or as you!

<p>
	Your mind judges it so.
</p>

<p>
	"Devilry" is a relative notion. I use that term but it isn't strictly true since EVERYTHING is Love from the absolute POV.
</p>

<p>
	Warlords in Liberia are actually a manifestation of Love. You just need a high enough perspective to see it.

<p>
	Not surprising at all because he made politics dramatic and exciting again.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are too bored with classic politics to vote. Trump polarized the entire field for better and for worse.

<p>
	It's like walking into a library with a gun and firing a few rounds into the air. You will grab everyone's attention and everyone will have a strong opinion about it.

	Lol
</p>

<p>
	The closest thing to Stalin that will ever happen in America is Trump. So your fears have ended up creating themselves.
</p>

<p>
	There will never be a Stalin in America because America has outgrown that possibility. This is why I never worried too much about Trump. It was obvious that Trumpism will never hold and it will never hold in the future because falsehood never holds.

	The one thing in common that all bad people have is this:
</p>

<p>
	They are unwilling to sit alone in a room and contemplate their own mind, instead they think the world is wrong and try to fix it.
</p>

<p>
	The one thing all the good people have in common is this:
</p>

<p>
	They sit alone in a room and contemplate their own mind until they realize that everything they thought was bad or wrong in the world was actually just the delusions of their own mind.

<p>
	Bad is not in the world. Bad is your own mind because you are selfish.

	It's so simple, But you refuse to hear it because you want some external evil to fight. But all you're ever fighting is yourself.

<p>
	Nothingness is identical to somethingness.

<p>
	Reality can have an infinite number of conscious beings at infinite dimensions and scales of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just like an ant cannot fathom what it is like to be human. A human cannot fathom what it is like to be a higher being. A higher being would operate in ways that are so advanced your mind cannot even think it or imagine it. It's not just a matter of being smarter or having a bigger brain. It's about entirely new ways so existing. Imagine existing in 10 dimensions rather than 3D. Imagine existing without even having a body.

<p>
	Don't be so naive.
</p>

<p>
	These people are ignorant. They do not have a clue what the US Constitution says or means. They are acting purely on ideology and emotional reactivity against progressivism.

<p>
	Their understanding of the US Constitution is a stage Blue myth. They are not at a a level of consciousness or development to actually abide by the values and principles of the Constitution because these people have no intellectual honesty and are too self-biased to care about anything higher principles other than acting out their believe and ideology.

<p>
	That's your problem. You've never actually contemplated what freedom means. You have some silly ideological idea of freedom as an absolute good that you're just acting that out without any deep questioning or contemplation or study.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you have no interest in questioning your self-bias. Your entire worldview is distorted by self-bias and the only way out of that is by years of serious and truthful contemplation and study. Parroting ideas like "freedom" will get you nowhere. You're just spinning your wheels. If you want to grow you'll have to let that go -- which of course you don't want to do because you think you've got the truth. Hence the tragedy of your situation. The thing you need to grow is precisely the thing that you have demonized.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it matters because it demonstrates the center of gravity of the level of consciousness/development of the majority. This matters very much. This is what allows you to predict which way the country will move.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I used this knowledge to predict that Trump would lose in 2020.
</p>

<p>
	It's crucial to know where the actual majority is at in their level of thinking. It's easy to get fooled by vocal minority groups who do not actually represent where most people are at.
</p>

<p>
	The electoral college system skews and obscures the true opinions of most voters. It's anti-democratic as fuck.

<p>
	Dude, you need to watch more of the videos and read the detailed reports. This mob was preparing to execute Pence.
</p>

<p>
	Just because it was a moronically executed coup doesn't make it any less of a coup. Trump's followers are buffoons, so of course they are not capable of carrying out a highly strategic and effective coup.
</p>

<p>
	They weren't just taking selfies. You are not treating this seriously enough. These morons fully believe that pedophile communists have taken control of the government and stole the election. So they feel fully justified in using violence to take back what they think is their original government.

<p>
	It won't be like that.
</p>

<p>
	First there would be years of therapy and basic self-help work.
</p>

<p>
	You don't jump from stage Red to stage Turquoise. You must go through decades of development.
</p>

<p>
	In practice someone like Trump is irredeemable. You can't force someone to awaken or develop unless they themselves want to. And he obviously doesn't want to.

<p>
	Not when the dissent is lunatic conspiracy theories and insurrection against the legit elected government.
</p>

<p>
	It's absurd that you expect to be able to use Twitter to rally an overthrow against the legit elected government. That is not a right guaranteed to you anywhere. In fact it is treasonous. If you want to betray democracy, do it on your own platform.
</p>

<p>
	Your logic is like you trying to rape a woman in her own house and then as she's kicking you out of her house, you yell in protest: "This is unfair! I should have the freedom to use your house to rape you. Stop infringing on my Constitutional freedoms."

	Poor analysis there.

<p>
	Trump is not a psychopath. He's a narcissist, sociopath, and stage Red ego.

<p>
	Although "psychopath" is vague and poorly defined term. My terms are more accurate and specific. When you study and understand stage Red, Trump's behaviors make sense. He's not some crazy person.

	100% prepared. I see no problem there. Maybe a couple of rotten apples at the lowest levels.

	Serious law enforcement is professional and they will do their job regardless of who it is they must defend. And at this point defending Biden is something you can be proud of thanks to Jan 6th.

<p>
	He would gleefully have him on for the insane ratings.
</p>

<p>
	The question for Spotify will be whether they want to be associated with the platforming of Trump and Jones. After Jan 6th, there will be massive backlash against Spotify if Rogan platforms any of these asses.
</p>

<p>
	Rogan's platforming of Alex Jones is especially bad because he makes Jones seem legit. He never aggressively calls out Jones' bullshit because they are personal friends.
</p>

<p>
	It needs to be said that Alex Jones also bears a huge responsibility for this. He has blood on his hands and people like Joe Rogan are stupid enough to still think that Alex Jones is cute and innocent, allowing him a platform.
</p>

<p>
	Alex Jones has brainwashed many of the hardest-core MAGA guys with his outrageous conspiracy theories and paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	It also needs to be said that Joe Rogan is an idiot for complaining about Biden not being fit for office. Rogan's assessment of Trump's danger is way off. He thinks Biden is more dangerous than Trump because Biden sometimes has some cognitive slowness. But Biden is a saint compared to Trump.
</p>

<p>
	All of the people who create false equivalences between the left and right need to be slapped across the face.
</p>

<p>
	It's complicated of course. There is no single factor. There are many factors that allowed Trump to squeak through.
</p>

<p>
	Hilary was badly demonized by the right-wing for 20 years unlike any other politician.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hilary certainly lacked a charisma crucial for political victory. She's just not very likable.
</p>

<p>
	But also never forget, Hilary still won the popular vote. Which means she was more popular than Trump!
</p>

<p>
	Trump is NOT a popular person. Only in MAGA world does he appear popular. But that is a lie they invented for themselves. MAGA is a loud fringe minority.

	As news trickles in, the events of Jan 6th are looking more outrageous and treasonous than initially seemed:
</p>

<p>
	Some of these MAGA guys are batshit crazy. It's worse than I thought. They were planning to execute Pence!

	They will be forced to go underground using their alt-media channels and platforms. But they already have been. Alex Jones style. That's what will become of MAGA. They will be a fringe group similar to neo-Nazis.

<p>
	Of course not. He's an idiot and he doesn't plan anything. He doesn't think through the consequences of his actions, he just acts impulsively from ego. That's how stage Red operates. It does not carefully strategize things.
</p>

<p>
	Trump simply doesn't care if his speeches and tweets cause harm to the country or cause some random deaths. He only cares about his own personal immediate gain.

<p>
	Of course Biden admin will be an order of magnitude better at containing extremism. But still, they can't stop every terrorist and crazy MAGA guy who makes pipe bombs in the back of his van.
</p>

<p>
	Don't even be surprised if some crazy MAGA guy tries to go after Biden or Harris directly. They need air-tight security. News media companies and web platforms like YT, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple need air-tight security over the next 12 months because these unhinged MAGA cultists will be butt-hurt and looking for revenge on liberals.

<p>
	The weasel is cornered.
</p>

<p>
	He's gonna end up as deplatformed as Alex Jones. This is actually very important because otherwise Trump would have used all these social media accounts to troll and agitate over the next 4 years. Now he can't. It's crucial that Trump not be given access to mainstream media platforms to start a new movement.
</p>

<p>
	Of course he will probably try to start his own media company.

<p>
	Just wait for the domestic terrorist attacks over the next 12 months. There will be some MAGA backlash to all this de-platforming and censure. Some of them are very radical and too far gone to listen to reason.

<p>
	Like I said, Trump is not a true strong-man. He's a fake. He doesn't have the balls to go through with an actual coup.
</p>

<p>
	If you're gonna do a coup, you can't half-ass it. You must do it full-bore. And Trump is not capable of that. Instead what he does is stir up shit and then deny it. He plays these con games -- but then denies any responsibility for the fallout. Because he doesn't understand how seriously these games can boil out of control. And of course once it boils over he denies any part in it because in the end all he's doing is looking out to save his own ass by any means possible.

	And how do you meet these girls? Via social circle?
</p>

<p>
	That might be your problem. You need to look for girls far beyond your social circle because your social circle is gonna reflect you. You need to diversify your portfolio, so to speak <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	You should also develop a basic method for screening girls for mental issues. Do it early on and reject those who don't have good mental health. You can design some screening questions to suss out history of mental issues without the girl even knowing that you're screening her.

<p>
	But if they start to see that the MAGA base has been publicly alienated and made nonviable in the mainstream, they will change their tune because their #1 priority is survival.
</p>

<p>
	It's just a question of how much foresight they have now. The MAGA base will definitely be made nonviable soon. But can they see that?
</p>

<p>
	Or have the Republicans drunk the MAGA cool-aid themselves? Many have. I'm not sure how many. It's a coin-flip situation. Might go either way.

<p>
	That is true.
</p>

<p>
	I don't have the numbers.
</p>

<p>
	But if you visit an incel forum you will see a lot of them using JP's anti-SJW positions to justify their toxic victim ideologies and demonization of women. Those numbers are very significant. I would bet that JP's Green shadow rubbed off on millions of people. That is what concerns me. How am I supposed to help evolve people to Green and above when JP is making them paranoid about Green?

<p>
	In the big picture it's all just a natural part of ever-expanding democratization.
</p>

<p>
	So, paradoxically, Trumpism is democracy at work. Democracy is just a counter-intuitive and nonlinear thing.
</p>

<p>
	There is a profound nondual connection between authoritarianism and democracy. These things are not really opposites. There is a Hegelian dialect going on here between the two.

			To bar Trump from office, the Senate would need to convict with a 2/3 majority. I don't see 17 republicans voting to convict. Yet I imagine there are alot of senate republicans that don't want Trump running in 2024. Yet, they also don't want to lose the MAGA base by convicting Trump.
		</p>

		<p>
			Republicans are in a tough spot. Voting to aquit Trump is really bad optics for center America. It's hard to justify Trump's recent behavior to average Americans. Yet voting to aquit Trump would outrage the MAGA base, which is about half the party. Yet as time goes on, Trump will lose flavor.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Don't forget that politicians are pragmatic above all else. When they sense that Trump is no longer useful to them because he is about to lose all his power they might turn on him on a dime to save their own asses.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, Republicans right now have an easy out to redeem their personal images. All they have to do is vote for impeachment. I think it's possible that 17 of them could be pragmatic enough for that. For example, history will look kindly upon Mitt Romney for being the only Republican to vote for Trump's first impeachment. Romney had integrity and he deserves credit for that. Republicans can begin to whitewash their image as soon as next week.
</p>

<p>
	Also, it seems like Trump can still be impeached after Jan 20th when Dems take the Senate. Which is another good option if McConnell is the obstacle now.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter if Trump is forced to resign via impeachment. Just impeach him. It's important that in history Trump goes down as the only President to be impeached twice. This is worthwhile to do. It will discredit far right-wing politics for generations.

			FYI, Kelly Loeffler officially conceded her defeat to Warnock yesterday. Even though technically there are still about 1-1.5% of the votes to count, right now Warnock lead has grown to 1.8%. Also, there are still about 4,370 votes left to count from Henry county, which is a moderately democratic area. The only other counties that are still not quite finished with counting all of there votes are small republican ones including Peach, Fayette, and Ware. Each fo those republicans are really almost done, and if you combine all of the remaining votes together that they have left to count, then they have an estimated total of less than 3,000 votes left to count.  So, the Loeffler campaign probably realized that all in all there's now absolutely no chance for her to win her race.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, Ossoff lead has grown to a full percentage point, and his lead is still seems to be trending upward. So, Ossoff will end up winning his race with enough of a comfortable lead.

	Most incels I see online are using these ideas not to get pussy but whine online about SJWs.

	Good!

<p>
	Having thought about this some more, I agree that there need to be as many consequences as possible for Trump and his movement. They need to be publically shamed and humiliated to the point where no reasonable person will want to be associated with it any more. Similar to Nazis. MAGA needs to become as stigmatized a term as Nazi. As soon as you identify yourself as a Nazi no one takes you seriously. Same should go for MAGA.
</p>

<p>
	Future generations need to clearly see that this kind of political behavior will never be acceptable and will have serious personal consequences. Devilry must be punished or it will spread.

			It saddens me deeply that people invest so much mental energy into these kinds of intangible fears. I have lost friends over this political right-wing nonsense. One of my old friends who spent a lot of time on social media slowly got indoctrinated into fascism. He legitimately believes that pedophiles run the country and that the only way to stop it is through violence. He would go on tirades about politicians kidnapping babies and eating them and SJW brainwashing and communist infiltration, race and IQ, the destruction of the white race etc. He called me an SJW and an apathetic hippie when I didn't express fear and indignation towards his imaginary super-villains George Soros and Rothschild and Mark Zuckerberg (even though he constantly used facebook).

<p>
	My guess is, once Trump is kicked out, sued, and publically shamed -- Trumpism will die out rather quickly and be replaced with some new brand of right-wing movement.
</p>

<p>
	Trumpism will look so ugly soon that it will need to be re-branded. But of course the fundamental ideology will still remain the same. Right-wing populism and its delusions are not going away soon.
</p>

<p>
	Think of the Tea Party in the Obama days. They basically rebranded themselves as MAGA.

<p>
	Of course they will try to make their own niche platforms to maintain their bubble of false reality.
</p>

<p>
	But, this will not work because all these right-wing platforms will be shunned by mainstream platforms and they will become very niche radicalized places with such extreme views and lack of moderation that they will eventually get shut down.
</p>

<p>
	This is what we see with platforms like 4chan and 8chan. Eventually even the hosting companied and payment processing companies will refuse to do biz with them. So will major advertizers. And so they will be relegated to the darkest underbelly of the internets.
</p>

<p>
	If there's one thing running this forum for 4 years has taught me it is this: no healthy online community can exist without serious and swift moderation against devilry. Exactly like society at large. A healthy society cannot exist without police. All the major online platforms are learning this lesson very deeply with the destruction they have caused. Facebook, YT, Reddit, Twitter, even 4chan.
</p>

<p>
	Operating a massive online platform is a great responsibility akin to having a child. You cannot have a policy of letting your child do whatever the hell they want.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, the vast majority of people prefer healthy, well-moderated online platforms that are free of trolls, extremists, cults, and toxic conspriacy theories.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, truth wins and falsehoods die. That's the beauty of truth. It always wins eventually.
</p>

	Blue-Yellow is an oxymoron. You probably just aren't familiar enough with the stages yet.

	Privacy rights are important to fight for. But this particular battle has been lost long ago at the business/consumer level. It needs to be waged at the federal level with privacy laws and regulations.

	Dude, there are so many better alternatives to JP that it's hard to know where to start listing them.
</p>

<p>
	Literally walk into any bookstore, ask for the self-help aisle, pick any random self-help book from the shelf and it will be better than listening to JP.
</p>

<p>
	The people who are awed by JP have simply never read any self-help authors or teachers.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	These people are brainwashed by the right-wing populist conspiracy theory alt-media echo-chamber.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just fringe stuff though, it's also FoxNews and the like. Basically any right-wing media source in the last 4 years. Including stuff like Tim Pool, Brietbart, Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, Jordan Peterson, etc. consuming all that trash ideology adds up to mind-cancer. Their sense of reality is so delusional and reactionary that they have lost all sense of decency and common sense. In their minds their actions are fully justified because they legit believe that pedophile communists are taking control of America. That is their worldview in a nutshell.

<p>
	Yes, of course. But Trump was a huge assemblage point for all the worst right-wing tendencies.
</p>

<p>
	Trump basically took stages Orange and Blue and appealed to their deepest and lowest fears, insecurities, gripes, hatred, anger, greed, racism, and nationalism. And they swallowed his con hook, line, and sinker because it felt so good for their egos to get validated. It's like dangling red meat before a starved beast.
</p>

<p>
	That is the epitome of demagoguery.
</p>

<p>
	Hitler did the same thing in 1920's Germany.

	But how long does that whole process take?
</p>

<p>
	Can it be done within a week or two?
</p>

<p>
	And what do you think Trump will do during those two weeks where he sees that he's being kicked out? He will go into hardcore attack mode. He will take off the gloves. He will fill his entire cabinet with fascist goons and loyalists and they will fight it as though they were fighting a real coup attempt. Is that worth it?

	Lol
</p>

<p>
	That's just an excuse you imagined so that you remain inside the dream.
</p>

<p>
	Realize deeper that your family and their suffering is just a dream you are hallucinating to keep yourself away from Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	What that is, is just fear of Infinite Love and formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are dead, your family will no longer exist.

<p>
	All that would do is kick him out of the White House.
</p>

<p>
	He would not be charged with any serious crime or face prison time.
</p>

<p>
	To put him in prison requires a long ass legal trail that will last years, and you need a hard crime like tax fraud.
</p>

<p>
	The current Justice Department rule is: You literally cannot charge an active President with ANY crime!

<p>
	Trump could shoot someone in the White House and he would not be chargable.

<p>
	It's the dumbest thing ever thought up by mankind.

			<strong>Pasting this:</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			"Courtesans were a part of a thriving culture of women who were learned, witty and wealthy. They wrote and performed music; they painted and danced. They provided men with intelligent conversation, artistic pleasure and sex. Courtesans were  different in many ways. They were not tied down to a husband and could enjoy the attentions of many men whenever they liked. They were also able to speak their minds on any subject, and were able to speak and think freely along any route they chose.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ancient Greece and ancient Rome both had courtesans as a very prominent part of the way the social fabric operated," Feldman said. "So did most places in the Far East and South Asia, India and Renaissance Italy."
		</p>

		<p>
			In Renaissance Italy, Feldman's field of study, courtesans maintained salons "where there was elevated conversation about philosophical issues, intellectual issues, theories of life and beauty," she said. "Some [courtesans] were among the best-educated and most literate and cultured women of their time."
		</p>

		<p>
			"The cultivated courtesan was a very refined, educated type of woman," said Doris Srinivasan, an art historian at the University of Memphis who will present a paper on courtesans in India. "She was respected; she had status; her position was not a degraded one. She was a woman of generosity, of wealth, of integrity, of education."
		</p>

		<p>
			Sex was also used as a way of gaining power and prestige. Courtesans were usually highly educated and well versed in the etiquette of the time but they were also independent and able to express themselves as no other women could.
		</p>

		<p>
			A courtesan or lorette was in control of her own life. She decided what lovers to take and she decided what was acceptable for her to do or say. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It seems as though selling one's body is a small price to pay for the amount of freedom that was allowed to courtesans. The courtesan who, in choosing her profession had already rejected society's constraints and was thus able to live in an open and free manner.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Interesting take.

<p>
	Yes, of course. That was Trump's higher function, so to speak -- exposing the systemic loopholes.

<p>
	Those are gonna be very difficult to prove in court.
</p>

<p>
	Treason is technically when you collude with a foreign power during a time of war. That won't apply here.
</p>

<p>
	And we've already established that the US President is above all criminal prosecution while in office. The Justice Department cannot even issue a criminal charge of a sitting US President.

<p>
	25th Amendment is possible if his most loyal cabinet decide to throw him under the bus.
</p>

<p>
	Once Republicans realize that Trump is about to lose all his power anyway, they may rapidly turn on him and throw him under the bus to save themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Soon will begin the phase where everyone who enabled and supported Trump will start to deny that they were really supporters of his.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, all of this will be denied by those who enabled it. It's just a matter of time. Once Trump loses power it could happen very quickly.
</p>

<p>
	Or the police were simply outnumbered at the moment and didn't want to incite mob violence.
</p>

<p>
	Police often allow a mob to overrun an area. We certainly saw this in the BLM riots. You can't stop a mob without full riot gear and hundreds of police in a wall.
</p>

<p>
	Looks like MAGA blitz the Capitol with a move so bold and shameless that it caught the police off guard. That's the point of a facsist blitz.

<p>
	Can the 25th Amendment be used on grounds that the President is a pathological narcissist? Because that is really his only problem.

<p>

	Don't focus on capping wealth. Just regulate and tax it properly.

<p>
	I have not found any methods that work well for me other than long and tedious-as-fuck full-time meditation retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically you need 100 hours straight of uninterrupted mindfulness concentration.
</p>

<p>
	But even then, you will fall out of that state once you stop the retreat. Changing one's baseline is the hardest thing.

What I'm talking about requires deep contemplation and probing. Weak people will stop long before they get that far. Psychedelics tend to be self-regulating. You go too deep, you freak out, and you swear them off forever because you're not serious about Truth.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, psychedelics are dangerous for sure. Extreme caution required. You could seriously fuck up your mind if you don't know what you're doing.

<p>
	Well, this will vary from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	For me, personally, psychedelics have not increased my baseline state much at all. But they have helped me understand reality at staggering levels of depth that no guru or video or book ever could. I used psychedelics to solve the ultimate riddle of existence. I became completely omniscient. The entire universe makes sense to me now.

<p>
	People don't believe and skip all the warnings anyways. And I'm sick of giving out warnings all the time. Half my videos are warnings about traps.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual work will fuck your mind up bad no matter how you slice it. That's the nature of the game. If you don't want to face death, don't do spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality = facing your own death head-on and coming out the other end. Anything shy of that is not serious spirituality, it's delay tactics.

<p>
	You mean effectively sex slaves?
</p>

<p>
	If you're talking about ancient cultures -- they all strictly controlled women's sexuality so that the most powerful men got the hottest women by the dozen on command at any time of day.
</p>

<p>
	The sexual marketplace has been carefully manipulated and dominated by powerful men for thousands of years to maximize their own survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you give powerful men the freedom to do so, they will hoard all the hot women for themselves and turn them into sex slaves. That is survival 101 for a man. Hot women are worth more than their weight in gold. That's why it happens unless there are strict laws and morals against it. And even so -- it still happens today.
</p>

<p>
	Never underestimate how far or how low a man will go for hot sex. If he's told to murder someone, he'll do it.
</p>

<p>
	The peak of my game was a Vegas 30-day challenge. I beasted full-time for 30 days straight in Vegas, 5 hours per night. I did something like 750+ approaches in that month. I even approached with a cold fever and dripping nose. In fact that night I got laid. I was having sex and wiping my snotty nose on the rough sofa pillow because my nose would not stop running in the middle of sex. It was unreal and not so pleasant. But it was training. My wingman was nailing her friend in the same hotel room. The four of us slept in the same bed.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah... that's beast-mode in Vegas. Off the hook. Crazy shit goes down here.
</p>

<p>
	I did it all 100% sober too.
</p>

<p>
	450 cold approaches to get my first lay.
</p>

<p>
	But keep in mind: 1) I sucked hard, 2) most of these approaches were short 20-60 second interactions, not 30 minute long sets, 3) your numbers will improve a lot after the first year of failure.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind this is a sample size of 1. My brother got a girlfriend from his 1st cold approach! So it's rather random. You never know when luck will strike.

			How many nights per week would you go out doing PUA?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many girls would you approach in a typical night?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends. When I was doing it seriously I would go about every night that clubs were open in the city I was in. Sometimes 3 nights per week. Sometimes 7 nights per week for a whole month. It all depends on what opportunities are available in your area and how serious you are. 2 nights per week should be minimum. That's typically Fri & Sat. You'll need to check your city and venues to see if it's worth making the trip out there on weekdays. Many times it's not worth it if you live in a small city.
</p>

<p>
	Typical night: 5, 10, or 20 girls. Depends on how busy the venue was. Some nights are just slow so you can't approach 20 girls. Sometimes you only get 5 or so. 10 per night is a great number to shoot for. But some nights it will only be 3 or 5 just because it was slow or you were chickening out.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 to doing massive approaching is that you need to find specific venues and cities that offer that opportunity. Your average bar does not have 10 girls worth approaching.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sure it is. My first two wingmen were two black guys in Dallas. Both of them got laid more than me because they were more experienced and had better game.
</p>

<p>
	Will you have a disadvantage with white girls? Sure, probably. But it doesn't really matter when you talk to 30 girls a night. You don't need to bang every girl you meet. You only need 1 per night to be down.
</p>

<p>
	If you're a black guy and you want a hot white girlfriend, this isn't a problem because all you gotta do is filter through 500 hot white girls until you find a few that love you. Is it worth it? Sure it is. You can do that in a few months.
</p>

<p>
	Remember.... you're not out to bang the whole female race. You're just looking for a handful of women. A handful out of thousands. This makes your goal much easier.
</p>

<p>
	When I was practicing game, it's even worth it to approach 300 pound whales. You are just being social and having fun. Lower your standards for socialization and approach. Just because you approach does not mean you need to end up having sex with her. She might have a cute friend.
</p>

<p>
	APPROACH ALL! -- should be your motto. Young, old, hot, fat, man, woman, gay, straight -- doesn't matter. Just approach and socialize. Sort the wheat from the chaff later.
</p>

<p>
	So put your money where your mouth is.
</p>

<p>
	But also, it shouldn't matter since you're doing a simple A/B split test with only one variable difference. You can do that for free on OkCupid or whatever online dating site. I have set up fake accounts in the past for both men and women, just to see how many messages I get. It's extremely eye-opening and depressing. Unless you're very good-looking it will kill your self-esteem.

	Yes, of course. What do you expect? To go from Zen master to Russell Brand in the snap of the fingers? You are not going to excel in all areas of life. Pick your battles.

<p>
	It's not just an ideology. Most humans are not that far from animals when it comes to how they have sex.
</p>

<p>
	Sex CAN be done consciously. But is it? Mostly no. Hence sex gets a bad rap.
</p>

<p>
	An important aspect of spiritual development is getting your sex drive under control. You can't do spiritual work when you are a horny dog who can't focus on higher concerns.
