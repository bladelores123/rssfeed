<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not just based on one man's reaearch, and it's a complex model that doesn't assign people numerical values for awakening, and like I always say, you need to understand that it's relative and has its limits.
</p>

<p>
	SD is much more robust than a linear numerical scale for nonduality.

<p>
	You do not know the degree of awakening of any human beings. Just keep that in mind. That is what is true for you. Anything else are beliefs you have picked up from hearsay or your own speculations.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea how awakened Ekhart Tolle is, or Ramaji is, or anyone. And even the notion that you could know is highly suspect.
</p>

<p>
	Assigning numbers to teachers is a dangerous game.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely important that you admit to yourself that you don't really know these things. Otherwise you fall into a delusion of thinking you know something which you actually do not know.
</p>

<p>
	If Ramaji's mind is corrupt, then his scale could be corrupt and you have no way of knowing that. You cannot just assume that his scale is accurate. To assume such a thing would violate the whole thrust of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, Ramaji's numerical rating of me was immediately incorrect. He rated me too highly and wasn't aware he did so.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot trust anyone in this work. No one! Not Ramaji, not Buddha, not Christ, not me.
</p>

<p>
	No, it is based on Ramaji's experience, which is hearsay/belief to you.
</p>

<p>
	You guys need to be a lot more accurate about identifying when a thing is belief/hearsay vs direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Awakenings do not come with numerical values attached. Lol. This is not even Ramaji's direct experience, it is something his mind is constructing.

			The main doubt/excuse  is this: I have a fear that if I'm going to approach a girl on the bus, on the way to school or even in school or in my town, people will start say that I'm a weirdo that talks to strangers and the consequenses that this might have scares me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So, are there other places where I can go to meet new people or I should brake through my fears?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	You will ALWAYS have that fear. That fear is not going to go away no matter which location you go to.
</p>

<p>
	It takes 1000s of approaches to start to get fearless. Until then, expects lots of fear. Approach despite the fear.
</p>

<p>
	Bus, sidewalk, cafe, mall, store, school... it's all the same.
</p>

<p>
	If it looks wierd it's because your mind imagines it so, and also because you are doing it in an uncool/creepy way. When done well an approach is never creepy or weird, regardless of location.
</p>

<p>
	You can even aproach a kissing couple on a park bench and have fun flirting with his girl. It's all in how you do it.
</p>

<p>
	You can even approach while she is with her mother and father and flirt with the whole family! Again, this requires some serious skill, so don't start here.
</p>

<p>
	The best location to start is bars and clubs because you can get away with a lot less skill and there are 10x more opportunities so you can blow up interactions without worry. During the day time you need to be much more precise than at night. Day time presents much less opportunities so you gotta strike with precision and skill.

			What happens if you are a product of abnormal circumstances ? How do you make sense of life ?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Normal and abnormal are purely relative.
</p>

<p>
	It's very possible that a baby might be born to an abusive mother who feeds him baby milk poisoned with lead so he will grow up with a brain full of lead which then causes him to become a murderer.
</p>

<p>
	This is all part of reality. In a vastly complex reality, all sorts of fringe cases happen.
</p>

<p>
	I have never said that everyone is saved in the way you imagine. A lot of people are born into fucked up survival situations which are totally "unfair" and "horrific".
</p>

<p>
	But all of this is still relative and does not diminish the absolute goodness and love of reality. Love entails freedom. And freedom entails horror. Love entails horror and "evil." So it all adds up in the finally tally. But any individual life can get totally fucked.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality does not promise anyone a good material life. Just the opposite, it guarantees that your material attachments will end in deep suffering. Which is the whole point of transcendence.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how good your life is, a day will come when you will be totally fucked. So transcend while you can.
</p>

<p>
	Tis a mistake to take such simplistic numeric scales seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening cannot be quantified or mapped on a linear scale.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, all of this is purely hearsay and goes against the core of this work, which is direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You have no clue whether these scales are accurate. You are just taking someone's word for it, giving away your own authority.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out, this can easily become a deep epistemic trap which skews your whole worldview.

<p>
	By your logic, all presidents would have to be populists because otherwise they couldn't get elected.
</p>

<p>
	Yet most presidents have not been populists. So clearly non-populist candidates win often and populist candidates lose often.

</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice this is solved simply by over-satisfying your needs.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're needy with girls, go sleep with 10-20 girls and your neediness will drop significantly.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot just wish your neediness away.
</p>

<p>
	The process you go through to successfully sleep with 10-20 females will cure you of much neediness. But it will be challenging process. Don't expect it to be easy. You will fail a lot. And that's exactly what will beat the neediness out of you. Every girl you lose will teach you a valuable lesson. You will come face-to-face with the ugliness of your own neediness.

</p>

<p>
	Do the practices or do not. But do not speculate about metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	All understanding about God must come from direct personal experience. All guesswork and speculation is wrong.

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of spirituality is to face what is true and face all of one's fears.
</p>

<p>
	Your father will never awaken so long as he fears seeing sinister astral beings.
</p>

<p>
	All fear is fear of one's own consciousness. And until this is full realized, one will never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	He should take psychedelics precisely because he fears them. What he really fears is himself.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	How on Earth can you reach such a conclusion from that set of facts?
</p>

<p>
	When you hear a phone call, you hear a phone call. That is it. It has no more meaning than that. The rest is your interpretation, imagination, and projection.
</p>

<p>
	"A phone call about a pizza means there must be a pizza somewhere and therefore an external reality" << This is your projection.
</p>

<p>
	What's real is PRECISELY what appears. If you don't see a pizza, it isn't. If you imagine there is a pizza, that's exactly what's true: you imagining a pizza. If you think there's an external reality, that's exactly what's true: you are thinking there's an external reality. But notice, thinking there is an external reality does not mean there is an external reality.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is exactly what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.
</p>

<p>
	A better analogy would be that every psychedelic is like a different musical instrument. You can hit the same notes using a trumpet, a piano, or a clarinet, but they will sound different.
</p>

<p>
	It's too challenging to describe differences in psychedelics using words. You must directly experience their differences to understand.

I dont believe in anything and how can I ever ? You can always be in states of pure delusion.
		</p>

		<p>
			Wether the brain exists or not - thats another question - but I'm 100% sure within this reality you can make some very specific cuts with a scalpel on a brain and that person will wake up thinking he is enlightened, met god, and will talk like the buddha. So you can not be sure of anybody - not big news - but how can you ever be sure that you yourself are not this person?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Psychotic states are no different really than "normal" states. Consciousness can take on an infinite number of states. All states are part of the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to access the Absolute is through direct self-realization. It is not even a process. There is no method. Either you are conscious of yourself as God or you are not.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is not a belief. It's happening right now.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not to enter some one true state. The point is to go meta and instantly realize the nature of all possible states, penetrating through them all.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is thinking of awakening as some kind of special state or position, when it is the transcendence of all states and positions. Once you transcend everything, there can no longer be a question about delusion or psychosis or "Is this real?" or "But how can I be sure?" or "But what if I'm wrong?"
</p>

<p>
	No! All of that junk is transcended. Not in theory but actually.
</p>

<p>
	It is in fact insane to believe there is a difference between reality and psychosis.

	You lack nuance, conflating absolute and relative domains.

<p>
	Just because there is an Ultimate Mystery doesn't mean we can't explain why there's shit in the toilet, and fix it.
</p>

<p>
	Your absolutist logic can be used to say, "Well, who really knows how the shit got there? It's all a grand mystery."
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe you just forgot to flush and are making up colorful spiritual stories to cover your ass.

<p>
	You have to take into account, though, that if all those 1000s of people didn't go on that cruise, they would be polluting individually back at home. Don't forget to take into account how much 1000 people shit, piss, eat, buy, throw away, etc. in one week back at home. Don't forget to factor in the cost of gas, oil, sewage, and water back at home.
</p>

<p>
	Just to stay alive requires pollution. How much do 1000 birds shit in one week?
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying cruise ships aren't wasteful, but context is important. Of course 1000s of people gathered in a small space will create lots of pollution.

<p>
	You don't need to have a child to understand how love feels and works.
</p>

<p>
	There is no fundamental difference between loving a child, loving a dog, and loving a car.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously a mother's love is self-biased because the mother chooses to love "my child" rather than a million other children on the planet. That why I call it selfish. But it's still love. Love is love. We're just talking about degrees of limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you could also say that a mother's love is selfless in that she would be willing to sacrifice herself for her child.
</p>

<p>
	But the same was true of Hitler. Hitler's love was also selfless in this sense because he was willing to sacrifice himself for his love of his country and his race. But as you can see, that was a very limited form of love.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, much higher levels of love are possible.
</p>

	Yes, that's life. That's a tricky balancing act.

<p>
	You are God in human form, so you both seek the infinite and the finite and you're torn between the two. You are divided. You seek unity but you don't know how to get there so you grasp around in the dark and you are addicted to division, so every time you grasp you make another division, thinking it will bring you to unity.

<p>
	Survival is a never-ending tail chase. That's true. Survival's function is to constantly look for more advantage, regardless of how much one already has.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			What is the relationship to survival and love? 
		</p>

		<p>
			For example from a woman's/mother's point of view, how much of her love for her partner and children is survival and how much of it transcends that. Does she logically have to know there's a difference to transcend it? Or does love transcend it in itself. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is love itself the structure? Can love not also be the content? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	These are tricky issues which are rooted in complex and profound existential dynamics that few people have any awareness of, and such understanding is not part of our shared culture.
</p>

<p>
	In the end everything is an unfolding of Love. But limited beings like humans get attached to limited forms of love and their capacity to love is very limited because they are preoccupied with survival and they are too unconscious and too selfish to love in the highest ways possible.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is just a limited manifestation of love. To kill another person to maintain one's survival is love for life. But it's a narrow, limited kind of love. Surrendering one's need/desire to kill another person would be a higher form of love.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is love! But a limited form of it. Selflessness is an unlimited form of it.
</p>

<p>
	A mother of course loves her children out of selfishness, self-bias, and survival, but this is still genuine love. It's just very limited.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem with limited and selfish forms of love is that they become an obstacle to much greater, unlimited forms of love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is all there is. It is the highest structure of all reality. At the level of the Absolute, structure and content become identical.
</p>

<p>
	We are Infinite Love. The trick is being able to live in alignment with that.
</p>

<p>
	Although, notice, "I want to improve my life" is itself a high-level structure which runs the whole show of how you go about doing this.
</p>

<p>
	It might turn out that the structure "I want to improve my life" itself needs to be questioned and gone meta on. Maybe striving to improve my life is a big part of the problem here? Maybe the very notion of "my life" is the problem?

			But the problem is that people can write me that "Language is enough and we dont need meditation and self inquiry because there are psychologists and with them you can go deep enough to core issues. So our culture right now is good enough! So you dont have to go beyond language at all."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a very deep ignorance to correct in someone. A person who believes that there is no value in existential investigation is hard to convince that it has value. It requires serious inquiry to start to appreciate the limitations of things like language, science, psychology, culture, etc. Only very seriously openminded and curious people will go down that rabbit hole.
</p>

<p>
	Entire books could be written (and have been written) about the limitations of science, language, and psychology. It requires a lot of reading, research, and personal contemplation to start to see a big enough picture, then the limitations become glaring. Until then it will appear like there are no problems.
</p>

<p>
	In practice maybe just skirt around the issue. Rather than trying to convince people that science or language is limited, just teach them whatever helpful thing you want to teach them which is beyond those limits. If you teach people helpful techniques they won't really care if it's "scientific" or not. People are suckers for effective, practical techniques that can help improve their life.

	How are you using her for your survival? How is she using you for her survival? What is the "you" that is being survived? What is her "you" that is being survived?

<p>
	Manipulation is another sub-structure that will be important to understand in the context of relationships. Notice how you too manipulate each other constantly to meet each others needs. This manipulation creates a dysfunctional dynamic. Successful relationship requires becomes conscious of your manipulations and letting them go. That's a lot of work since you manipulate so much and you do it so seamlessly and habitually.

<p>
	Get very clear about what you want and what the costs are.

<p>
	You don't know that. You haven't even bothered to contemplate or observe what desire is. Maybe if you looked at it, you'd find out. After all, there it is -- in you. If you can't understand it, who can? After all, we're not talking about understanding moon rocks or kangaroos, we're talking about the desires you feel and act out every day.

<p>
	The whole point of spiritual practice is to deconstruct and undermine the self -- that thing you call "me".
</p>

<p>
	You're damned if you do and damned even more if you don't.

<p>
	If someone says that to you, run away while you can.
</p>

<p>
	Such reassurances don't need to be made in healthy relationships.
</p>

<p>
	Your descriptions of him are getting more and more toxic and dysfunctional. There is no way this will work, so don't feel bad, you're not really surrendering anything workable by leaving. You are simply accepting that this is unworkable.
</p>

<p>
	You will save yourself years of suffering and dysfunction by leaving now. Such a guy can drag down your entire life. So treat this rationally. Don't let your feelings for him cloud your wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Frankly, why are you settling for this shit? It's like you go to a nice restuarant, they serve you a turd, and you persist in eating it. Stand up and walk out.

</p>

<p>
	If you're into this work, you need to find partners who are willing to actually communicate, self-reflect, and be conscious about how they relate with you.
</p>

<p>
	Find a guy who values personal development so you can be on the same page.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get stuck in a dead-end relationship. It's better to be single.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It tends to be both sudden and gradual. The deepest insights are sudden and startling. But they are deepened gradually over time as one chews on them.
</p>

<p>
	To realize something like What is God?, or What is no-self?, or What is Love?, etc. these come as shocking, sudden epiphanies. They are not merely insights, they are totally new states of consciousness. Such a thing will startle you. It's not gonna just creep up on you quietly.
</p>

<p>
	Gradual expansion of baseline awareness via mediation is good and important. But that's not good enough. You need those epic mindfuck epiphanies which reveal facets of the Absolute.

<p>
	No, memory is mental imagery. That is not consciousness proper. That is mind activity.

	The Absolute cannot be stored in memory. Memory happens inside the Absolute.

	This is a crucial mistake. You cannot get to the Absolute through memory.

<p>
	It's a delicate balance of staying open to feedback and willing to re-asses one's position, but also being very clear about what the Absolute Truth is and not giving an inch when it comes to that.
</p>

<p>
	One of the fruits of lots of serious self-inquiry is that you become grounded in direct experience so deeply that other people's ideas/beliefs no longer become important.
</p>

<p>
	Basically you ground yourself in Consciousness, God, Truth, and Love. When you are coming from that place, nothing else matters and you have true strength.

	There cannot be a relationship without honest and genuine communication where both partners can air their thoughts & feelings without argumentation or debate. It's called "clearing". You two sit down, each takes 5 minutes to talk without interruption and gets everything of his/her chest. Then you switch sides. No interrupting, no debating, no rebutting, no justifying, no criticizing, no name-calling, no blaming. Just say how you feel and what you want. Let him do the same.
</p>

<p>
	Of course he must be emotionally mature enough to handle this kind of communication.
</p>

<p>
	If he cannot handle it, if he refuses to try it and put effort into it, then leave him because it will never work anyway. A relationship with such a person is impossible.
</p>

<p>
	Masculine/feminine is a duality. You cannot define yourself as a man without simultaneously defining yourself a not a woman.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really work on one without affecting the other.

<p>
	Consciousness & lots of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You have many, many layers of inauthenticity to shed. It's difficult to see how deep your inauthenticity goes without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Deep authenticity is impossible so long as you are dominated by fear and survival -- and the ego is all about fear and survival.

<p>
	That is the crux of the matter.
</p>

<p>
	That is gonna limit your growth. The highest wisdom will not be supported by society at all. You will be all on your own. In fact, people will tear your down and demonize you and call you crazy. And you have to be wise and strong enough to laugh off their ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorant people love to gaslight the wise with their ignorance. You gotta rise above this kinda thing because you will encounter it a lot going forward. I get it on a daily basis.

	If you are male, female itself is your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	You are not really male or female. Both are dualities. You include and transcend both.
</p>

<p>
	Work more on integrating your feminine. That's part of what gayness is about.

<p>
	A) American healthcare has massive profit margins. You cannot compare it to other countries. Cutting those profit margins is very hard because they don't want to give it up. It's like taking away crack from an addict.
</p>

<p>
	B) If all the sick people are offloaded onto public plans, public plans will pay all the cost while private plans will offer cheap insurance for healthy people who don't need it. For the public plan to be affordable it needs to contain many healthy people to offset the sick ones. This is how insurance works.
</p>

<p>
	Having a single giant pool is ideal. Then everyone is invested in it and no one can manipulate it or want to cut it.
</p>

<p>
	People on private plans will want to cut public plans because it doesn't benefit them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why private plans are not allowed in many countries which have a public system.

I'm telling you from personal experience at 18 I had a permanent enlightenment experience that put me in the now due to nearly a decade of depression and suicidality. It made depression go away and it felt like peace on steroids with a sense of awe and wonder that I can tap into to this day. Yes I can say that experience is real. However the idea of everything having consciousness has not come to me. I'm more than open to it I am a truth seeker however as of yet I've not reached that truth. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, I mean enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your experience was, it could have been a genuine awakening but it was still just like dipping your toe in the ocean.
</p>

<p>
	There is much deeper and wider to go.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and facets to awakening. Deep and total awakening is extremely rare. Mostly people get glimpses.
</p>

<p>
	You have much more to contemplate and understand.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you are not conscious of what consciousness is, what reality is, or what other is. Which is why you ask your question.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully awake you would not be asking if rocks have consciousness.

I can see how say a biological thing like bacteria, animals have consciousness. But I want to know directly how could I know 100% no doubts that a rock has consciousness or a table his it?

<p>
	Nothing "has" consciousness. Consciousness has all things. Your paradigm is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	How can you know? By awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You are not doing the practices. That doesn't fly in this work.

<p>
	This is fairly typical if you go deep into the work.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is not controlling you. The devil is purely imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	If you're feeling lost and down, you can lean on the power of love.
</p>

<p>
	Self-love is what you are missing.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can give you a powerful love awakening which really helps to take the sting out of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Look, people have different genetics, brains, and psyches. They process things differently and chemicals affect them differently.
</p>

<p>
	Clearly psychedelics are not for him.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like he is extremely sensitive to them and he has zero foundation for it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that some people actually are psychotic, psychopathic, etc.
</p>

<title>Is the endgoal of humanity robot consciousness?</title>

<p>
	There is no robot consciousness. There is no human consciousness. There is just consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're asking, "Is the goal of my TV screen to become Mario? Or robot Mario?" No! The goal of your TV screen is be free of attachment from any shape so that it can display all shapes.

	Good example of how a stage Blue racist really thinks when push comes to shove:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0ivVo5ZTQc?start=149&feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>

</div>

<p>
	Great example of ego, ego, ego.

</p>

<p>
	"Niv Sch" will confuse people because it will mean nothing to them. They will not even recognize that as your name and they won't know how to pronounce it or spell it.
</p>

<p>
	It is helpful to create a catchy brand name that's unique and easy to remember and pronounce. That alone won't ever make you successful or popular, but having a low quality brand name just makes your life needlessly difficult.
</p>

<p>
	If I named by channel: "dksfulxkjNdfww", that would be a problem.

	This thread has been moved out of the High Consciousness Resources sub-forum due to not meeting quality guidelines. This is not a high consciousness resource.
</p>

<p>
	But carry on.

<p>
	You're misunderstanding a few key points.
</p>

<p>
	1) All models are limited. There is no such thing as "a valid model".
</p>

<p>
	2) You are expecting a social consensus and authority on cutting edge insights which almost no humans know about. That's not how knowledge works. Maybe in 100 years you will have that. But by that point your presention will be useless because everyone will already know it. The whole point of cutting edge teachings is that people will deny them like subborn mules. So this idea of using authority firgures to prove your point is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	3) You need to spend a lot more time studying Spiral Dynamics and developmental psychology in genernal before you can appreciate what SD offers and its limitations.
</p>

<p>
	4) SD is a very complex model which maps very complex phenomena. This is not like mapping a few molecules or billard balls, which is easy compared to mapping the collective human psyche.
</p>
