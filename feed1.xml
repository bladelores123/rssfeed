</p>

<p>
	Learning is so much more enjoyable solo, without all the stupid tests and class schedules.
</p>

<p>
	As long as you have the motivation for it.
</p>

<p>
	College curriculums are so lame. They don't cover the most important and juicy topics.
</p>

You pass through it. It's not solid enlightenment yet. And it doesn't happen to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	I have a vid called: The Dark Side Of Meditation, which covers this to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	Solid awakening is the most awesome thing. Assuming you're the metaphysical sort of person. If you're attached to being an ego, then it could be a problem.
</p>

<p>
	I've never experienced anything as good in life as awakening. But that's me.

			So, what do you think about doing a cheaper program first, and establishing a coaching business? I've seen a couple that looked decent for around $2000. And they were about six month long courses. Then, with the money from that coaching business, going and completing the IPEC program? I know it's not ideal, but that's really the only way I can slice it that it seems actionable.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I can't speak to those cheap programs. $2000 sounds very cheap. Most decent coaching programs cost significantly more.
</p>

<p>
	But I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. Something's better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Some coaching programs might even have payment plans. Check with IPEC. You can call them and do a free consultation and ask all your questions. They are pretty honest and straightforward.
</p>

<p>
	Some programs can definitely be scammy, so watch out. Especially with the really cheap ones. In the case of coaching programs I tend to believe that you generally get what you pay for.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Sounds like you need to be more strategic with making income. $10,000 should be something you can easily afford if you live in Murica. Don't work in low-paying jobs, think bigger.
</p>

<p>
	We had a long thread about it here a long time ago, which I started.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty controversial.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with it is, to you, it's just hearsay.
</p>

<p>
	You must seek direct experience rather than building up spiritual beliefs about extraordinary things.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I personally found it interesting is because it independently corroborated my direct experience of Absolute Infinity. Can't speak to the rest of it.
</p>

My question is how much water did you use to dissolve ~10mg of 2C-B. There's not much information on stuff like this out there.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	As little water as you can get away with.
</p>

<p>
	Like 0.5ml
</p>

<p>
	20-30mg of 5-MeO can be dissolved in as little as 0.1-0.2ml. Literally a few drops.

At the very least read up on them.
</p>

<p>
	It can also be very eye-opening to get coached yourself. So you can see how it feels.
</p>

<p>
	But doing an in-person coaching programming is really the key. You will learn so much.
</p>

<p>
	For you, since you already have an audience, it might make sense to take out a loan/credit to do the coaching program since you are basically guaranteed to make the money back (because you have an audience).
</p>

<p>
	You can probably make $10,000 back within 6 months of finishing the program. Program takes about 1 year to finish.
</p>

<p>
	You're actually losing money every day by not taking the program. But this is unique to you, because you already have the hardest part done: building an audience. This is not the case for most new coaches.
</p>

That course is my life's work, struggling to figure it out for myself. It is no small thing. The course is really just the tip of an iceberg. If a person is unwilling to do the course, they are not remotely serious about this issue and will never resolve it anyways. Life purpose is not something for lazy slobs.
</p>

<p>
	I invested about 10 years figuring it out until I finally did. The principles are all there. But it takes serious work to actualize it.
</p>

<p>
	It's worth the work in the end. Unfortunately so few people will ever see that. Just like enlightenment. It's so amazing, but who will ever get it? Almost no one. Almost no one will realize what life can be.
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for too little vision.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	IPEC is a really good program (which I did).
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they teach some business stuff, but the real value of it is they train you how to properly coach, which is quite difficult to learn on your own. You will meet lots of people there who you can practice-coach with to build up your skills. They will also teach you lots of great techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Coaching is not what most people think it is. Coaching is NOT about giving people advice. Coaching is about asking powerful questions which facilitate the client to contemplate. Coaching is actually more powerful than giving people advice. Any fool can give advice, but very few people can coach. Coaching requires humility.
</p>

<p>
	Coaching skills are very versatile. They are not limited to business or spirituality or life purpose. You can use those skills to coach in whichever sub-specialty you want. You can definitely become a spirituality coach, if that's your passion.
</p>

<p>
	I might have 6-8 clients at my peak. But I was never a full-time coach. That was never my desire. Turned down many clients. Most of my time went into shooting videos. I have probably coached over 100 people in total.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can see you would make a great coach. The only question is, do you really want to be a coach? To be a good coach you gotta want to work with people one-on-one and deal with their "stuff". It can be very rewarding, but it's not for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I prefer mouthing off in videos rather than coaching people. But coaching can also be fun. A different kind of fun.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I doubt you'll find a coaching program with a spiritual focus. That is unnecessary anyhow.
</p>

<p>
	And IPEC is all about consciousness, consciousness, consciousness. That's all they talk about. Just not in a woo-woo way. It's toned down to appeal to ordinary folk. You can teach and coach spirituality without ever telling a person it is spirituality or "God", and they will eat it up. They'll think it's the most amazing and powerful thing. But you can phrase it very plainly and pragmatically.
</p>

<p>
	Or... you can go all fucking woo-woo and pull out the crystals and group chanting <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> Same thing, different window-dressing.

<p>
	I have never been a fan of the whole no-fap movement.

<p>
	Fap serves a useful function when used properly. Running around like a horny dog is problematic.

<p>
	If you do no-fap, it has to be done in a non-repressive way and for some good reasons, like maybe if you're getting into serious pickup or yoga.

<p>
	It's not enough to "know" it. If you're still using the word "I" you don't get it yet.
</p>

<p>
	This is the crux of self-inquiry and it requires thousands of hours of inquiry on this very point.
</p>

<p>
	Don't go looking for "new stuff". You must go deeply on this one thing until your realize you never existed. This is no small thing.

</p>

<p>
	Like, gay people should stop being demonized and denied jobs.
</p>

<p>
	Or black people should not get shot by police for sneezing.
</p>

<p>
	There is obvious discrimination which needs to be addressed.

<p>
	There exist literally thousands of video courses, seminars, and workshops which teach marketing in painful detail, for virtually every industry.
</p>

<p>
	There are courses for how to market carpet cleaning, dentistry, weight loss, surgery, information products, websites, vitamins, self help, life coaching, consulting, whatever.
</p>

<p>
	And there are courses which just teach general marketing principles.

<p>
	The biggest difference between Green and Yellow is that Green believes its value system of equality for all should be universal, but Yellow understands it is just another perspective. Also, Yellow is self-aware of the stages whereas Green is not. Green believes it must conquer all the lower stages whereas Yellow understands that all stages have their place and that the entire Spiral has a purpose. Green tends to demonize lower stages whereas Yellow is above that.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow tries to guide people up the Spiral whereas Green tries to get everyone to become Green. Green does not understand that a Blue person cannot become Green without first living through Orange.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a clever egoic trick. There are in fact far more viable and healthy interpretations than Peterson would lead you to believe.
</p>

<p>
	He makes it sound like his Christian-based solutions are the only ones that would work. Which is far from the case.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of cultural relativism is to acknowledge all the weird and diverse solutions that cultures have come up with. Peterson just glosses over this part.
</p>

<p>
	One of the serious downsides of the stage Blue traditionalist worldview is that it is incapable of learning from other cultures because it holds itself as the one superior culture.
</p>

<p>
	For example, why is Peterson not talking about Hinduism? Yoga? Advaita? Buddhism? Sikhism? Paganism? Jainism? Concepts from Islam? etc. Some of these cultures have far superior spiritual teachings to Christianity, which is extremely corrupt and degraded.
</p>

<p>
	And, the most positive and meaningful life comes from dropping all interpretations as much as possible. You see how JP is avoiding infinity? Trying to make it finite?
</p>

<p>
	It's not just that JP rails against the radical left. I would criticize the radical left too. The much bigger problem is that he paints most of the left as radical left. Which is utterly absurd. Obnoxious college feminists in their early 20's do NOT represent the mainstream left almost at all. That's like 1% of the left. The most immature version of the left. It would be like representing all conservatives as KKK.
</p>

<p>
	He is making a mountain out of a molehill. As if a handful of obnoxious college feminists are about to take over the world. Please!
</p>

<p>
	That's a very worthy cause.
</p>

<p>
	But also be mindful of the complexities of this system. Be careful that you don't inadvertently design a system which is even worse. Complex systems which handle tens of millions of people are notoriously difficult to design.

<p>
	If you get triggered, that's ALL you! It's all about how your mind is failing to understanding the complexities of reality, denying reality.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is, people eat animals and you don't like it. That's not the world's problem, that's your problem. Don't project it on them. Own it.
</p>

<p>
	Triggering is never in the situation, it's in YOUR interpretation of the situation. If you were fully awakened, Hitler himself torturing kittens would not trigger you.

	Of course it depends on the school. I am assuming you'd go to a good school, not a madrasa.

<p>
	Of course you can always find exceptions.
</p>

<p>
	We are talking about general guidelines for people, not what works for 1 in 1000.
</p>

<p>
	A solid education is very important.
</p>

<p>
	And don't confuse success with personal development and consciousness. Just because someone drops out of school and earns millions of dollars doesn't mean much. He could be selling tobacco to children or a used car salesmen.

<p>
	Bullying is a separate issue. Of course if there is lots of bullying in your school that will sour your whole education experience.
</p>

<p>
	Bullying varies a lot from school to school and by geographic location.

<title>Strong anger towards meat-eaters</title>

</p>

<p>
	In other words, the reason you are angry at them is because you have actually disowned this meat-eater part of yourself. You've told yourself it it wrong, but this was really a denial rather than a genuine transcendence.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate with a journal how you have disowned this part of yourself and created an identity around being a moralistic non-meat-eater.
</p>

<p>
	What is your ego getting out of hating meat-eaters? It's getting something! There's some secret payoff.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation actually tends to not resolve shadow issues. You need to contemplate, not meditate this issue.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down with a journal and dig into why you procrastinate. What is really going on there?
</p>

<p>
	Don't speculate. Sit down and contemplate it seriously. You might be surprised what you discover. The root causes are not always what they first appear.
</p>

<p>
	Keep probing this question day after day for at least a week. Get deep with it. Explore your true psyche. Ask yourself why you are doing all this. If it's fear, what do you really fear and why is it so bad?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You keep saying "I", "I", "I"... but notice, there isn't one. Stop screwing around and try to pinpoint what this "I" is that you claim you are.
</p>

<p>
	If the "I" cannot be pinpointed, then why are you so sure you exist? Why keep saying "I"?
</p>

<p>
	What if "I" is just a word which points to nothing? Like Santa Claus or unicorn.
</p>

<p>
	What if you are just an idea?
</p>

<p>
	What if you cannot die because in fact you never existed?
</p>

The fundamentals are still the same.
</p>

<p>
	The one thing I would change is, if you have a clear sense of direction, college is not necessarily the way to go. I now feel that college is only right for certain types of people and certain types of majors.
</p>

<p>
	If you're self-driven, you can out-perform college by your own.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it all depends on what you want to do with your life. If you want to be a doctor or engineer, college is basically a must.

<title>Life Coach Program Reviews/Thoughts</title>

<p>
	Most coaches cannot sustain a living doing coaching because they are just bad at marketing themselves and getting clients. It has little to do with your coaching skills and more to do with your business and networking skills. Coaching is traditionally a very network-oriented business. You need to be a good networker, or a good online marketer.
</p>

<p>
	I am a bad example of a coach because I don't really coach people and I don't network. I sort of created my own category of online philosopher because I never really cared to be a traditional coach.
</p>

<p>
	If you are a great networker and really hustle, you can certainly make low six figures. But this is highly usual for coaches. Most coaches can't make $20k/year because they don't realize that coaching isn't about coaching, it requires business savvy.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, it's gonna be tough to be a coach at your age. You're just a bit too young and immature still and people will not take you seriously (and they aren't wrong). You need more life experience and more theoretical foundation. But don't let that discourage you. You can still lay the groundwork now for a coaching career in your late 20's and early 30's.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect any cookie-cutter formula or coaching programming to land you a 6 figure income. A 6 figure income is only possible through creative, original thinking and lots of hustle, above and beyond what most coaches do.
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime, you can try to find a career which will get you more experience, like counseling students in college or working with substance abuse victims or tutoring teens or some kind of community organizer jobs. Jobs like that can be a good segue into coaching later on, as they allow you to develop people skills and start practicing mentoring.
</p>

<p>
	To be a good coach you have to enjoy working with and mentoring people. You also need to know how to sell people on the value of coaching. People are generally very hesitant to pay hard money for soft advice. You gotta find ways to make coaching very tangible and practice for people. Like, "I can help you save your marriage" or "I can help you double your salary".
</p>

<p>
	Fame is like pouring gasoline onto an already toxic and deluded ego-mind. It makes the ego drunk with power.
</p>

<p>
	And the day after you get everything you ever wanted will be the most depressing day of your life. People overlook this point in our materialistic culture.
</p>

<p>
	Unsuccessful people cannot appreciate how hollow success is. Successful people can.

<p>
	But regardless of its flaws, finishing 12th grade is a must in my opinion.

You will actually need credentials and those fields are so technical and deep that it's very hard to teach yourself all that. And college does a pretty good job teaching hard technical fields, so you might as well take advantage of the structure they offer.
</p>

<p>
	Where college really falters is with teaching life skills, job skills, creativity, business, psychology, personal development, philosophy, spirituality, and how to be a great human being. Those you must teach yourself using resources outside of college.
</p>

<p>
	My views on college have evolved.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, I want to shoot a video about it.
</p>

<p>
	I think there are many problems with college. Especially if you must go into massive debt to do it.
</p>

<p>
	College is good for certain specific things like: engineering, computer science, physics, etc. But is a waste of time for many others.
</p>

<p>
	It really depends on how self-driven you are and how good of a sense of direction you have in life. If you have a strong sense of life purpose, follow that rather than college.
</p>

<p>
	I now prefer self-education rather than college, but this will only work for people who are self-driven.

<p>
	It couldn't be any other way. No true happiness is possible without awakening, so you will never attain it so long as the ego is alive.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a mistake. This is by design.
</p>

<p>
	What you intuit is that you need awakening. Your intuition is correct but you don't yet realize just how correct it is.
</p>

<p>
	You've been playing a losing game your whole life and now you're starting to suspect its a rigged game.
</p>

<p>
	To expect happiness without awakening is madness.

	This is the crux of the problem. You are assuming it can/should be explained without realizing that BEING is prior to explanation and is irreducibly mystical. This one of the core mistakes of science.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to stop explaining and to start BEING.
</p>

<p>
	Explanation is a finite, second order thing. The nature of reality is such that all explanations must be incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to symbolize Truth, which is impossible because Truth is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	You can BE the Truth, but you cannot know it.
</p>

<p>
	You can try forcing an explanation (as science does) but if you do that it automatically becomes incomplete and relative, not the Absolute.
</p>

<title>Where are the PAST and FUTURE stored?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/24228-where-are-the-past-and-future-stored/?do=findComment&amp;comment=270237</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Past and future are concepts occurring in the now.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the ego-mind is trying to understand how/what the now is, and to do so, it creates concepts.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind is busy trying to demystify the now, but in fact, the now is mystical and it is a wrong move to try to demystify it. In an attempt to demystify it, ideas like past and future get created, which lead to a false understanding.
</p>

<p>
	So the counter-intuitive move to surrender to the fact that the now is literally magic, without a past or future.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that past and future are posited because otherwise the mind just cannot accept the raw truth that the now is here all by itself. That would be too eerie, too woo-woo for the ego-mind.
</p>

He can be surprisingly openminded.
</p>

<p>
	As for his fanbase, that's another matter. Lots of Sam Harris and JP worshiping going on there. Lots of materialism, lots of atheism, lots of rationalism, lots of libertarians, lots of do-you-even-lift testosterone bros.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, Joe has a very broad audience. It's just the loud-mouth trolls who yell the loudest.

</p>

<p>
	Every stage is supposed to build on top of the ones before it.
</p>

<p>
	Pathology occurs when a new stage emerges and tries to suppress the lower stages. Which, of course, every stage tries to do.
</p>

<p>
	The key evolutionary developments of stage Green are acknowledgement of relativism, the impulse towards universal equality, and environmental consciousness. These are all good things which are necessary to soften Orange's cut-throat individualism and blind materialistic ambition. This is a much needed solution to Orange chaos.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage creates it own kind of chaos which the next stage then evolves to resolve.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to Blue chaos was Orange. The solution Orange chaos is Green. The solution to Green chaos is Yellow.

<p>
	I do it late at night. But that's probably not ideal for most people. I can't do it in the morning because my nose gets clogged in the morning.
</p>

<p>
	Time is not the the issue, it's about doing the various sets, however long that takes. Earlier in this thread I gave you a few routine stacks, from newbie to advanced. They usually take 30m to 1h 20m, depending on how many sets you're doing.

<p>
	I stopped conventional meditation. I just do Kriya instead + I randomly just sit and look around the room whenever I feel like it.
</p>

<p>
	After a few months of Kriya your mind should naturally start to calm down and you should start to feel like you're naturally meditating whenever you take a moment to just sit and be quiet. Meditation also becomes much more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
	After Kriya, my meditation has become much more organic, less forced and artificial. I meditate when I'm taking a piss, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Because the yoga rewires the brain stem. It's more of a hardware fix than a software fix. It's more like a psychedelic in this regard.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's one of the problems with his whole system. Same with Sam Harris.
</p>

<p>
	For JP, that comes from his Blue traditionalist Christian values. Christianity is traditionally very moralistic, which is a classic case of shooting their followers in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like JP cannot accept the deeper truth that all morality is a human invention and that to be truly Good you must abandon all moral ideologies. A truly conscious person does not moralize because he's conscious that evil literally does not exist and that ALL is Good so there is nothing to moralize about. Moralization is something the ego does. And you can clearly see Peterson falling into this trap with respect to the post-modernism, socialism, and stage Green as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	A classic Christian, stage Blue, conservative trap.
</p>

<p>
	The very reason that JP is fighting against post-modernism is because stage Green's relativism undermines all transitional notions of good vs evil. Which is correct! Those notions are human inventions! But JP does not want to bite that bullet and pass through post-modern nihilism to more advanced stages of morality, which are based on consciousness, not human ideas of good vs evil. JP feels that to admit to relativity is to open Pandora's box of chaos. Stage Blue fears chaos (stage Red). Which is why the subtitle of his book literally expresses his fear:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But this fear must be surrendered to, not fought against. Stage Green is not chaos, it's just a new, higher kind of order.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue creates rules to keep itself from sliding into chaos. Stage Blue becomes the anal-retentive rulekeeper stereotype, which leads to all sorts of neuroses (which are well-hidden from public view through suppression).
</p>

<p>
	JP has created a public identity out of fighting against chaos. Which is precisely just his own shadow.
</p>

<p>
	The profound irony is that JP hasn't cleaned his own room. Which is why he's acting out in public.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is a tricky beast. Especially the mind of an intellectual.
</p>

<p>
	"The better the model, the bigger the problem."
</p>

<p>
	Everything that's happening to JP is predicted by Spiral Dynamics, if one would just bother to study it closely. When it comes to people's behaviors and ideological positions, there's little new under the sun. There's nothing original about how conservatives behave or think. It's very robotic. Predictable like clockwork. In fact, they pride themselves on that.
</p>

	The mind will never get this. This requires a radically altered state of consciousness. Your consciousness must dilate open. A few thousand hours of intense mediation will do it. Or some psychedelics.

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is Nothingness. Which is why you can't grasp hold of it.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is not an experience. It is Absolute and Mooji don't matter at that point. You are Mooji talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Mooji was pointing you to Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	I am not enlightned but I have seen the Absolute many times at this point from a variety of angles, deeper than some teachers.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen the Heart Sutra's truth for myself, and it is true as fuck. Realizing the Heart Sutra is what you want.

	The only trouble is becoming so insanely conscious to see it.
</p>

<p>
	It's right there under your nose. Don't go looking elsewhere. You are inside Nothingness at all times.

	Because when you finally realize it, you'll say, "OMG! It's NOTHING!!!"
</p>

<p>
	There are many words for it that we use:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Nothingness

	<li>
		Formless

<p>
	How could everything be distinct from nothing? Nothing is nothing, so there is nothing to keep it from fusing with everything.
</p>

<p>
	No, I have not redefined the word. I am trying to show you that the distinction between something and nothing is in fact relative.
</p>

<p>
	The universe actually cannot tell the difference between something and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse this for word games. Something extemely profound is being pointed at here.

<p>
	How could it not if nothing is the same as something?
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming nothing and something are distinct. This is a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	You are writing this because nothing in the universe has ever happened. So everything happened. So here you are.

	Without a distinction between something and nothing you'd be dead. So it's very difficult for you to see that something is nothing as that would collapse reality and derail your entire life.

			I don't know why you guys enjoy saying "everything is nothing", because that's not true.

		<p>
			But I guess it depends on the definition of "nothing", for me the definition of nothing is really really really nothing. And I think that's the correct definition. So it's wrong to say that everything is nothing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think you guys are just bending the word 'nothing'. What's the point with that? Is the point that it's a cool thing to say "everything is nothing" and "you are nothing"?
		</p>

		<p>
			You change the word 'nothing' to a half-assed 'nothing'. Let the word mean really really really nothing instead of half-assed nothing.

<p>
	No, you are not hearing what is being said.
</p>

<p>
	These are not word games. Nothing actually is identical to everything.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect to understand this using your rational linear mind. This requires a deep enlightenment to grasp. We talking about the ultimate structure of all of existence here! Don't except this to be easy or logical.
</p>

<p>
	All your ideas of nothing are not nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The closest you can get to nothing is by looking around the room. That is actual nothing.
</p>

<p>
	---------
</p>

<p>
	Just trust my guidance on this one guys. Otherwise you will waste years looking in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
	I am pointing you straight at nothing. But it's extremely radically and the mind doesn't want to see it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic to speed up the realization. This one's a doozy and will take you 20 years to realize sober.

<p>
	Something didn't emerge out of nothing. Rather, something and nothing are identical and indistinguishable.
</p>

<p>
	0 vs 1 is a distinction or a difference you're latching onto.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that there is no difference between 0 and 1. Or in other words, there is only a difference between 0 and 1 if you say that there is, otherwise there isn't.
</p>

<p>
	Pause, look around the room, and notice that everything you see is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire life has been nothing, only you had mistaken it for something.
</p>

<p>
	All this time your mistake has been thinking that everything around you is something when it is in fact nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing looks precisely like the "physical universe". Nothing is NOT an empty hole like you have always imagined.
</p>

<p>
	Bring God into your own life first, then you will understand.
</p>

<p>
	There is no greater source of evil in the world than those who try to bring God into the lives of others without first succeeding in bringing God into their own life.
</p>

<p>
	God unrealized is the devil.

<p>
	"Physical" itself is a hollow, relative term. Really contemplate: What does "physical" even mean?
</p>

<p>
	Physical vs non-physical is a conceptual distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Even real vs unreal is a conceptual distinction.
</p>

<p>
	All distinctions are relative, and not the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	But it gets even weirder!
</p>

<p>
	Even the distinction between relative vs absolute is itself a conceptual distinction! Such that there can be no difference between something and nothing, form and formlessness, reality and illusion, enlightenment and non-enlightenment.
</p>

	This shows that you do NOT know what "ALL THERE IS" really means.
</p>

<p>
	ALL THERE IS....
</p>

<p>
	Think about that. That's everything!
</p>

<p>
	So what the hell are you talking about? What is more than ALL?
</p>

<p>
	ALL is an absolute. "More" is a relative term which does not apply to the ALL.
</p>

<p>
	ALL includes all other realities already.
</p>

<p>
	If you can think of something beyond the ALL, then your notion of the ALL wasn't actually the ALL.

<p>
	Tone is the least of JP problems.
</p>

<p>
	The deep structural issue is that he is programming his fans with stage Blue mentality, against Green. It stifles movement up the Spiral, which is what's necessary for people to find God. So he's shooting his own fans in the foot.

	If someone hits a castle made out of Legos with a hammer, the castle will break. So will your sense of self & life.
</p>

<p>
	What remains is no-self.
</p>

<p>
	You only exist as an idea. This idea will die and all that will remain is the universe.
</p>

<p>
	With a broken brain, you will not longer to able to say or think, "This is my life". And thus "you" will cease to exist as an ego. Sights, sounds, and feelings could still arise, but there would be nothing claiming ownership of them.
</p>

<p>
	No-self = True Self
</p>

<p>
	Where you go is, you die.
</p>

<p>
	You only exist now as an idea.

Consciousness is the only thing that you've ever encountered or can encounter. The rest is a conceptual framework you've invented within your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	"Physical objects" is a concept within consciousness. Take a look at what that really is.
</p>

<p>
	"But maybe there is still the possibility that reality can be physical" << that's a concept within consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	To discover that the materialist paradigm is wrong you must closely examine what "physical", "material", and "matter" really are in your direct experience. You must discover that they are concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics also help a lot in this deconstruction.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is a matter of belief. You must sit down and ACTUALLY look at what is real in your direct experience. This is called contemplation or self-inquiry. The answers are inside you, if you would just bother to look. Don't look for arguments, look at what is ACTUALLY the case in your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is an illusion of course and nothing has any meaning already.
</p>

<p>
	The universe will never end though, it will just turn into a unity and fragment back into infinite multiplicity.
</p>

<p>
	Fun idea to contemplate: the beginning of the Big Bang and the end, heat death, are actually identical because you cannot distinguish them.
</p>

<p>
	Space and time are illusory human inventions. You can become conscious that they don't actually exist.

</p>

<p>
	God is precisely not a map or a meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson's work is what keeps him from discovering God.
</p>

<p>
	His intuition is right that God is worth seeking. But he does not understand how to realize God because he's stuck in orthodox Christian notions of God, which are extremely misleading.
</p>

<p>
	And then his silly politics stems from that.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and have an honest conversation with her about your intentions towards her. Tell her you like her a lot, but that you don't feel she's "the one". You can suggest that you could still keep seeing each other, if she still wants. But now she will know how you feel and she will have more realistic expectations.
</p>

<p>
	It will be heartbreaking for her, but it will better than stringing her along. And ultimately she should understand.
</p>

<p>
	The key thing is that you aren't leading her on with false expectations.
</p>

<title>First time problems</title>

<p>
	Having sex outdoors in public is pretty hard and scary. Not to mention if this is your first time ever having sex.
</p>

<p>
	You should be much more comfortable in a secure indoor environment where you will not be interrupted or have to rush.
</p>

<p>
	Logistics, logistics, logistics. 70% of getting laid is planning out the night properly so that you two end up alone in a secure location.
</p>

<p>
	Also, do not get overly sexual with a girl unless you are ALREADY in a secure location. You must close the deal, otherwise she will often get too creeped out by the situation and not give you another shot. It's too awkward to get naked with someone but not have sex. And girls hate that kind of awkwardness.
</p>

<p>
	Next time, make sure you close. You, as the man, are responsible for planning things such that you can close.
</p>

You can find such people on online pickup forums.
</p>

<p>
	Approaching is one of those things which feels very difficult at first, but is actually a lot easier than your mind makes it out to be.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to learn to approach solo. It helps a lot to a few seasoned wing-men.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to find the right locations to do your approaching (mall, nightclub, cafe, etc). Some locations are much better than others.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but he also drank quite a bit of ayahausca.
</p>

<p>
	I've discussed this issue with him in private at length. His consciousness of nonduality seems legit. As in: permanent nondual awareness.
</p>

<p>
	But he admits, and I agree, that his awakening was rather unusual and unique to him. Not a typical result.

<p>
	P.S. If you work on making yourself a great man, she will never want to leave you. In fact, being less possessive of her will make her love you more.
</p>

<p>
	It's like reverse psychology.
</p>

<p>
	If you are a weak man who isn't working on improving himself, then yes, she might leave you from something more exciting.
</p>

<p>
	She doesn't really want another girl, she wants more passion, excitement, adventure. So give her more of that. You want that too.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a relationship is to grow and explore together. That's what keeps it from getting stale.

<p>
	You can learn all the techniques and psychology behind attraction and relationships. That is not a problem. In fact, it's very important and women will ultimately appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem arises when you start to turn all of that into an ideology and identity, the way PUA culture does. Don't become that alpha-bro manwhore who runs around chasing women all the time and bragging about it.
</p>

<p>
	Attract women, but above all, be a good kind man. Don't become a manipulative used dick salesmen. Learn to develop deep relationships with those women you attract. Don't do it for the sex or the ego, do it for the growth opportunities.
</p>
