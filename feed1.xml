</p>

<p>
	Spiritual powers are a seperate thing from realzing total nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	I am talking about total nonduality here, not spiritual powers.
</p>

<p>
	I do not understand why Martin does all that energy movement stuff. To me it is irrelevant to nonduality. I guess that's just his way. For me it is not like that.

</p>

<p>
	When you awaken, you will realize you have no choice in the matter.
</p>

<p>
	Your ego still thinks it is in control. Hence it is asking these moralistic questions.

<title>Transpersonal Psychology</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Just to clarify, transpersonal psychology is not enlightenment. It is more about spiritual and mystical experiences, but short of full-on nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	It's still a great field to study.
</p>

Having a worldview of any kind is false nihilism.
</p>

<p>
	True, realized nihilism is total nonduality. You ain't even close to that yet.
</p>

<p>
	All ideas about reality are basically false. So start dropping them.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is Nothingness. This cannot be understood using the mind. It requires a deep awakening out of materialism and duality.

<p>
	One of the biggest obstacles to moving up the stages is all of the fears, judgments, and false narratives one has constructed about the next higher stage.
</p>

<p>
	You're gonna have to admit to yourself that your negative judgments of stage Orange people have been too simple-minded, lacking wider context and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of stage Orange (or any stage of people) as evil or bad or selfish, then obviously you can never grow to embody that stage.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston, Jed, Sadhguru, and a few others. It's hard to be certain because there are so many facets, degrees, and nuances to nonduality, and different ways of talking about it.

He seems to dismiss the builders of the Pyramids too easily.
</p>

<p>
	It's rather arrogant to think that these people 5000 years ago were able to build those structures technologically, they had an enormous purpose and drive, and yet at the same time it was all just to glorify the egos of a few ruthless kings. That theory doesn't add up in my book.
</p>

<p>
	The other possibility is that the ancient Egyptians tapped into spiritual realms and insights that even Sadhguru doesn't know about.
</p>

<p>
	I'd be careful about underestimating the Egyptians. They seem unbelievably advanced, beyond what the materialist paradigm can fathom or explain.

Yes, Neti Neti, or self-inquiry, or yoga, or meditation, or 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is the most direct and surest way. You will experience pure, total nonduality the likes of which cannot be imagined or spoken of.
</p>

<p>
	Experiencing total nonduality is not easy. It usually takes enormous work. It took me about 4 years of hard work every day, and the only reason I succeeded was thanks to 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Most people here pursuing enlightenment will never realize total nonduality in their lives. It's too deep. But with 5-MeO it becomes very doable.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is the next best thing, since 5-MeO is hard to find. But LSD will still not take you deep enough. But it will still give you a good glimpse and knock your socks off if you use it properly.

</p>

<p>
	It seems more plausible that the Pyramids where tools to boost spiritual practice. The Pyramids may not have been the creations of egotistical kings but just the opposite.

<title>Where do you find a community for enlightenment in day to day life.</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	People into Western yoga are generally into self-improvement. Try joining a local yoga class and schmooze with them. They will introduce you to like-minded people. Western yoga classes exist in every city in the world at this point I think.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect people there to be into hardcore enlightenment work. That kind of community is very rare. For that you need an ashram or a spiritual workshop lead by some enlightened guru.
</p>

<p>
	As always, be careful with group-think. Even the most enlightenment-oriented communities are full of corruption, dogma, idol worship, politics, rituals, and distractions (see Osho documentary to see how bad it can get).
</p>

<p>
	Serious spiritual work is best done solo. 10-day solo meditation retreats are the shit. But for newbies, a community can be useful to start off.
</p>

<p>
	Sign up to a Vipassana retreat in your area. You will meet some serious spiritual practitioners there.
</p>

<title>How to prevent homeostasis?</title>

<p>
	I REALLY appreciate homeostasis after a bad trip. You go so deep down the rabbit hole, to the point of madness, and then homeostasis kicks back in and brings you back down to Earth. That's when you say, "Thank God for homeostasis! Otherwise I would be drooling in a wheelchair in an insane asylum."
</p>

<p>
	Never forget that homeostasis keeps your ass alive on this mortal plane. Which is why it's so damn stubborn. It's really looking out for your safety, like an obsessive, neurotic mother: "Honey, did you remember to take your sweater? You'll catch a cold!"

<title>Is mindfulness through intense suffering the best way to &quot;kill the ego&quot;?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/20418-is-mindfulness-through-intense-suffering-the-best-way-to-kill-the-ego/?do=findComment&amp;comment=217362</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Best example would be strong determination sitting or doing a 10 day solo meditation retreat. The suffering experienced there, while you are fully mindful and not distracting yourself with anything, is like Miracle Grow for the soul.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with most forms of suffering is that people suffer mindlessly, never looking into the root of the suffering because they are distracted with entertainment or business or relationships.
</p>

<p>
	A classic shaman's vision quest in a great example of this. You go into the desert all alone with no food or water for 3 days. You suffer so much you start to have mystical experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus supposedly did that for 40 days in the desert.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha basically did that too under the Bodhi tree. He sat there and sufferred mindfully.
</p>

<p>
	Retreats create lots of mindful suffering for me and grow me the most. Psychedelics also create mindful suffering, AKA bad trips, which are very healing.
</p>

<p>
	It works because suffering is just the ego's unwillingness to surrender to reality. So by suffering mindfully without escape or distraction, you force the ego to die. It is like exposing a vampire to sunlight.
</p>

<p>
	The only trouble is, it's uncomfortable and the ego hates it.
</p>

<p>
	This is a really great solution to this problem.
</p>

<p>
	Also, psychedelics are very effective at disturpting the status quo, which is why they are banned by governments.
</p>

<p>
	Also, ego backlash is not necessarily wrong or a bad thing. It is a sign of growth. Nature evolves through oscillation, like a wriggling snake. Reframe every ego backlash you have as: "Ah, another lesson to make me wiser."
</p>

<p>
	The key to ego backlashes is to be mindful of them as they happen. Don't necessarily try to force-stop them. Use of force is actaully part of the root problem.
</p>

<p>
	Mistakes and failures, when observed with mindfulness, are not mistakes or failures at all! And even failure at mindfulness isn't necessarily a mistake.

	They weren't enlightened. But they had some good intuitions and principles and understanding of human psychology, which makes their teachings useful for personal growth.
</p>

<p>
	One does not have to be enlightened to have useful and profound insights about how to live a good life.

	Quickest way to enlightenment is 5-MeO-DMT. But mindful suffering is pretty good too.

<p>
	Of course it is also true that unconscious people tend to be much less responsible with their sexuality, driven by 1st and 2nd chakras, so they end up spawning more babies and also infecting their minds with low consciousness beliefs and neurosis.

<p>
	That's heavy stuff. Will take some deep work to unwire that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics and shamanic breathing might prove very useful for processing that.

<p>
	With awakening, you will realize you are perfect however you are. So chin up.

<p>
	That is a great point. For those of you still far from awakening, start by tapping into the beauty in your life. That feeling of beauty is really powerful. Learn to cultivate it and channel it as often as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Beauty is all that remains after enlightenment. Just infinite beauty everywhere. The entire universe is one sublime work of art. A perfect masterpiece!

It's a legit part of the spiritual domain and people naturally have tons of questions about it.
</p>

<p>
	People have started threads here before about all sorts of occult topics. They just don't usually label it: "Occult"
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful. It's a DEEP rabbit hole full of many potential traps and delusions.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt there is anything sweeter than total nondual awakening.

</p>

<p>
	I've had awakenings which were far more profound than infinite love. But infinite love is great.
</p>

<p>
	The most profound awakening I've had so far was pure Nothingness, pure Mu. It was beyond love.

<p>
	Bashar is a good example of a channeler.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear l never said whether channeling is good or bad. It is just a thing. Whether you should pursue it is not easy to answer.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with judging spiritual techniques or methods with which you have no direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	From what I currently understand, what you really want is enlightenment. But it's good to know that stuff like channeling is really possible if you care about fully understanding how reality works.
</p>

<p>
	There are many facets to spirituality besides pure realization of nonduality. Way more facets than people realize. Like demons, angels, spirits, dieties, entities, astral realms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't get too distracted by all that stuff. Go for enlightenment first. Dabbling in the occult can be big distraction, and poses risks.
</p>

That is a beautiful, heart-felt experience, but not enlightenment or even a mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	With enlightenment, it is as through you broke your entire perceptual system. It is a deeply metaphysical thing. Physical reality collapses. Life and death become identical. It is such a radical shift in awareness that your mind cannot even imagine it in your wildest dreams.
</p>

<p>
	It is so radical that it is beyond all human notions of beauty, emotion, and profoundity. It just leaves you paralyzed in awe, as you realize that you just died.

<p>
	Actually, this is probably not true.
</p>

<p>
	There is a higher power working through you, even if you are full of ego. A divine intelligence is guiding you, which is why you are attracted to enlightenment in the first place. If not for this divine intelligence, there would be no hope of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire to be a healer is probably genuine deep down inside, it is just hampered by your lower chakra, fear-based, self-preservation instincts.
</p>

<p>
	What you need is simply spiritual purification, purging all of your lower chakra baggage.
</p>

<p>
	It is like you are a light bulb that has been covered over with so much rust and grime that only a few rays of light are radiating out. As you clean off the grime, you will shine with the infinite, eternal, unstoppable light of God. The ego will be annihilated in this light. And then you will become a great healer.
</p>

<p>
	But start with babysteps. This whole process will take years. You are right where you need to be. Follow your heart, it is filled with divine intelligence and will show you the way.
</p>

<p>
	You understand, right, that 100% freedom means I am free to kill you and rape your daughter, right?

<p>
	You libertarians do not understand the contradiction in your own moralistic ideals.

<p>
	True freedom is the last thing your ego wants. Which is why instead of spending this time to awaken to total nondual LIBERATION, you are mental masturbating about a silly ideological fantasy.

<p>
	What you seek and don't know it yet, is AWAKENING.
</p>

<p>
	When you understand fully what reality is, you understand what death is. Death does not exist.

The search for meaning is directly the avoidance of emptiness. Because in truth, all meaning is illusion, and BEING is meaningless. The ego hates this. But the good news is, once the ego is shattered and total nonduality dawns, you will relaize that BEING is far more profound and superior to meaning.
</p>

<p>
	BEING is what you see on psychedelics. Now imagine if your whole life was like that. Your life would be so empty, it is infinitely full. And from this position of total selflessness, you can do anything and help anyone with ease and joy.
</p>

<p>
	Your intention to help people is great, you're just going about it too shallowly. If you really want to help people, awakening should be your top priority.
</p>

Nothing original here. It's just boilerplate libertarian dogma, based on a highly naive understanding of human nature, how social systems work, and government.
</p>

<p>
	Any libertarian system you envision will quickly devolve into a murderous and opperessive military dictatorship.
</p>

<p>
	There is a very good reason why not one single libertarian form of government has ever existed. And this is it.
</p>

<p>
	No human society functions on libertarian principles. And none ever will.

</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in the rat race. So of course stress would be normal with that. Your entire lifestyle is materialistic and fear-based. That's understandable. You are just trying to survive. But it isn't how you would choose to live if you became deeply conscious of what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying to drop everything and quit. I am just saying that as you become more conscious, your lifestyle will change to be slower, less forced, more healthy. And then the stress will be less of an issue.
</p>

<p>
	Underlying this entire pursuit of survival is a deep sense of inadequacy and fear of emptiness and death. All of that seems like it's normal and "just how life has to be", but that isn't true. You can learn to live conscious and healthy. But explaining how is too much for a forum post. That requires a lot of research and trail and error to figure out.

	Oh, some fun gossip about David Deida.
</p>

<p>
	I once went on a date with Tony Robbin's copywriter. She knew all the dirty secrets. She told me that Tony Robbins had to physically kick David Deida off his cruise ship because he was getting handsy with Tony's wife. Lol
</p>

<p>
	Oh the delicious irony of it all...

</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	It only makes sense in the naive mind of a libertarian.
</p>

<p>
	You realize, right, that in international waters there are pirates who will murder your community, right? So those gunboats = military = government = taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Your offshore community will turn into a drug-addled dictatorship with rampant murder, theft, rape, and enslavement. And at the helm will be a self-proclaimed narcissist who claims to be the second coming of Christ, divinely ordained to "keep the peace" and spread his brand of spirituality across the land at gun point. Until the US government sends bombers to nuke your little offshore cult. And that will be the end of that sorry little chapter in history.
</p>

<p>
	When you don't have a direct consciousness of how ego works, you will get yourself into pickles like this.

<p>
	Yes, in a free world, humans create governments to murder each other.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever liberatrian society you construct will be conquered by a neighboring government which doesn't care a damn bit about your libertarian ethics.
</p>

<p>
	No one cares what you agree with. That's the point. Power is exerted without your agreement. It's utterly childish to not understand this basic point of life and human nature.
</p>

<p>
	In a perfectly libertarian state, one group of humans will band together, create a corporation, conquer and enslave the rest of you libertarians, and the end result will be military autocracy, until the people revolt back, overthrow the enslavers, and establish a democratic government which mandates civil rights and property rights for all citizens equally, and enforces any violations of this mandate at the point of a gun, using taxation to finance that gun.
</p>

<p>
	So the end result of libertarianism is already what we got: government mandated democracy. All you're advocating without realizing it is an devolution back to the times of ancient Rome, where 45% of the Roman population were slaves.

	That's only because they don't know how to use them properly.
</p>

<p>
	I have successfully use psychedelics to become conscious of every facet of nonduality. Total nonduality, beyond anything humanly imaginable. So much nonduality, that I see most enlightened masters now as not fully realized.
</p>

<p>
	David Deida, for example, is not fully realized.

<p>
	Enlightenment is the realization that you have always been dead.
</p>

<p>
	No one was born. Nothing is happening.
</p>

<p>
	The confusion about this comes from that idea you have of death as being "lights out." That is not death. That is your materialist idea of death, which turns out to be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Death cannot make sense from the materialist paradigm. It only makes sense once you're dead.
</p>

<p>
	No self = death
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha was a man who sat under a tree and meditated for so long that he died. But then his body kept on living and teaching for another 40 years. How that is possible you cannot understand so long as you are alive.
</p>

<p>
	To awaken, is to awake up from life, in the same way that you can wake up from a bad dream to realize it wasn't ever real.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Life Is A Dream

<p>
	Emotional responses vary WILDLY. Obviously the person stealing, murdering, or enslaving isn't having an emotional response against it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that you cannot rely on emotional response alone to make people behave ethically. You cannot rely on Hitler having compassion which stops him from sending children into ovens. The whole point is that Hitler lacks that compassion. As do millions of other humans.
</p>

<p>
	Taxation is theft only under an absurdly egocentric worldview.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with libertarianism at its core is that it is based purely on egocentrism. The fantasy of libertarianism is that everyone is a free and sovereign individual. That has NEVER been the case. You are not an individual. You are infinitely related to everyone else in your community, whether you like it or not. Your survival depends on them. Humans have never survived or existed as individuals. Even Neanderthals were tribal. Even our chimp ancestors from 5 million years ago were highly tribal and communal. There is so such thing as an individual chimp who does not pay his fair share of taxes. All chimps pay the equivalent of taxes or they are kicked out and left for dead.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are a communal species with communal obligations. Your job is to accept that rather than concocting an ideology to rationalize it away.
</p>

Why can you not just still comfortably with the stress? Why are you running away from it?
</p>

<p>
	Notice that if you sit down with any negative feeling, there will be a kind of agitation there, and it will feel "lonely" for lack of a better word, facing it.
</p>

<p>
	Just having a bunch of stress in your life is not the same thing as addiction. If you just have lots of stress, that's already a symptom of some deeper problem in your life, and chances are really good that that deeper problem is only a problem because you are afraid of facing emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Example: You are stressed about finishing all your school work because deep down you are afraid of failing school and ending up with nothing -- AKA emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Example: You are stressed about pleasing your husband because deep down you are afraid that otherwise he will leave you, and you will end up all alone -- AKA emptiness.
</p>

He is deluded with ego. He's got a really really bad case of rationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Stay away from ideologies like that. It is just a modern version of religion. It's everything I've warned you guys about in my epistemology videos.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "universally preferable behavior". That is an egotistical fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	These ideas are so wrong, it's hard to even know how to start curing a mind of them.

	Yes, but behind this stress is something even more real: emptiness!
</p>

<p>
	You can't stand stress because it feels too bleak and empty to face all alone, so you want a companion for that emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it's hard to tolerate that stress very mindfully is because there is an emptiness to it.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is always looking for movement and agitation because otherwise the stillness is too much to bear. It's too "real". So you seek escape from the suffering of emptiness into pleasant emotions. Because your mind is addicted to stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	The value of understanding a problem at its root is that you stab the hydra in the heart rather than merely chopping off one of its many heads.

<p>
	Guys, careful not to treat Kriya yoga as a quick enlightenment fix. That's not at all how it works. You need to be in this for the long-haul.
</p>

<p>
	Questions such as: "Do you see a light yet at your 3rd eye?" are the totally wrong attitude.

</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video that destroys libertarianism at some point. It's so simple-minded and wrong that it's like an absurd joke.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as the non-aggression principle or morality or ethics AT ALL! Reality has no rules. Any rules you see, humans invented.
</p>

<p>
	The reason the non-aggression principle doesn't work, has never worked, and will never work is because there is normative reason why everyone should obey it. Animals obviously do not obey it, and nor do humans. You can act moralistic and self-righteous by claiming the the non-aggression principle, but then some human can always come and kill you, rape your daughter, and take your property. The whole point is that no one cares about your moral principles except you, because you invented them to suit your ego.
</p>

<p>
	Property doesn't exist, BTW. It's a human invention. As are all moral codes. They are all groundless and untenable. The only thing that enforced property rights is government, at gunpoint. And even then, it's not guaranteed, so don't take it for granted. Someone can always steal your property. I had $24,000 stolen from me, which I couldn't recover even after winning a court trial. The only way to get it back would be for me to go to the guy's house and beat down his door with a gun. And even then, he probably won't have $24,000 in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
	Drop this libertarian ideological game and start doing real self-actualization work. All of that Stefan Molyneux stuff is pure egotism and it seriously hampers your ability to do consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	It's childish. Just drop it. Thank me later.
</p>

<title>What parts of religion/ spirituality are real?</title>

The only way you can find out is by doing your own personal investigation with direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	No matter what anyone tells you, it will just be hearsay and stories from your perspective until you directly experience it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about exploring the outer limits of reality, you should watch my episodes about epistemology very carefully and apply the principles taught there. The #1 principle to all serious investigation of reality is: be radically open minded to anything and everything. Don't judge. Seek to verify every claim with personal direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be amazed at how far that one principle can take you, if you bother to apply it seriously, and you are genuinely curious to know the TRUTH.
</p>

<p>
	Asking about such things on an online forum, or debating such things with people, shows a lack of seriousness and a gross underestimation of the nuances and complexities of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to ask, but don't expect any serious resolution of your existential questions via an online forum. The things you are asking about cannot be spoken of or even thought about in many cases. You need to start to appreciate the depth of this communication gap.
</p>

<p>
	You can start by reading all of the 5-star rated books on my book list -- especially in the Consciousness, Epistemology, and Paranormal categories. That will give you an good theoretical foundation to follow up on with direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	To answer all of your questions will probably require 10-20 years of serious spiritual practices. Just so you understand the depth of what you're asking about.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	An additional point of clarification:
</p>

<p>
	Some of you guys pounce on each new technique I share as though it was the silver bullet to solve all of your problems. That is the wrong attitude. Doing a self-help technique once or twice and expecting something miraculous to happen is the wrong attitude.
</p>

<p>
	I never said that this technique will produce enlightenment. That is not its goal.
</p>

<p>
	This technique is not a replacement for meditation, yoga, or self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Deep psychotherapy can take years and costs tens of thousands of dollars. So if this technique can speed up that process by even a factor of 2x, all in the comfort of your own home, that would a huge thing.
</p>

<p>
	Then how do you explain that Sadhguru and Peter Ralston both have daughters? And Shyama Lahiri (founder for Kriya yoga) was a householder with kids?
</p>

<p>
	Careful with making broad-sweeping narratives about enlightened people. It tends to be as problematic as making general statements about any group of people (black, white, Asian, gay, women, etc).

<p>
	Who's to judge what is and isn't earned?
</p>

<p>
	You think your "hard work" is of your own doing??? You think somehow it isn't a gift from God? You think you stumbling upon yoga or meditation was your own doing and not a gift given to you? Such egotism!
</p>

<p>
	Be careful acting as though you have a choice in how things unfold. You don't. "Earned" vs "unearned" is an egoic notion. Everything is the manifestation of Infinity and could not be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Be grateful for any higher consciousness you come across, however it comes to you. Otherwise, it's like you're spitting in the face of God for giving you a gift. (Of course, you're free to do that too.)
</p>

<p>
	P.S. While you're at it, you may as well stop meditation, self-inquiry, and yoga, because those are also "unearned". You stole those techniques from other people who invented them the hard way. You are just riding on their coattails like a lazy bum, looking for a shortcut to God, too weak-willed to carve a unique path through the jungle of delusion for yourself <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Awakening is just nihilism fully realized.
</p>

<p>
	If McKenna sounds "nihilistic" to you, that's because that's the way YOU are reading him.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse lack of sugar-coating with "nihilism".
</p>

<p>
	There is a certain compassion (masculine compassion) that comes with being ruthlessly blunt about a matter, as opposed to glittering it up with promises of 72 virgins. The ego-mind tends to hate direct Jihad. It's too much for an ego to stomach unless one is really spiritually mature.
</p>

	But also, keep in mind, that people will have different journeys to awakening. For some people the journey will be very hellish and bleak, for others it will be more heavenly and lovey-dovey. That's gonna depend a lot on your personal karma and how your mind interprets the journey.
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind, there are many degrees of awakening. Certain levels may be sweet while others bleak. Again, depending on how your mind interprets it. For example, some minds will find it horrifying to discover that there is no right/wrong, while others will find this delightful. Some minds will find it atrocious to discover that God is nothingness, while others will find this beautiful.

<p>
	If that's true, how can you be sure you're not insane right now?
</p>

<p>
	Have you forgotten that THIS experience of reality you're having right now is determined by the brain? What if your brain is functioning ignorantly RIGHT NOW!?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: It is! You are mentally ill and you don't even know it. Your mental illness is otherwise known as materialism. Of course the whole trick with being afflicted with this illness is that you deny that you have it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	So take your own advice. The problem isn't that you're being too skeptical here, but that you're not being skeptical enough! You are blindly accepting your default level of consciousness. Which is a massive epistemic blunder.

<title>Shamanic / Holotropic Breathing Mega-Thread</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	A few pointers for you guys:
</p>

<p>
	1) This question of whether oxygen is being increased or decreased is really irrelevant. Don't get hung up on that. What matters is if you feel the technique working for you. If you feel like it is harming you, then don't do it. For me, it feels healing. Obviously people can have all sorts of health conditions which might make this technique inappropriate, in the same way that running 2 miles on a treadmill is inappropriate for many people. But for most healthy people, it is healing.
</p>

<p>
	Medical doctors and academics can say all sorts of things. But the proof is in the actual doing of the technique. Do not listen to people who have not actually done the technique. Spiritual techniques tend to be hardcore. They can also be counter-intuitive, breaking conventional medical, physiological, and materialist paradigms. Case in point: most medical researchers still do not understand psychedelics for example, so don't expect them to understand a technique like shamanic breathing.
</p>

<p>
	With naive thinking, a doctor could easily classify running a marathon as unhealthy and physically dangerous, pointing to isolated factors like: "There is less oxygen in the blood than normal" or "There is more CO2 than average", "The muscles are producing lactic acid which is damaging to the body", "The heart beat is near heart attack levels", "The body temperature is near fever levels", "Dehydration is too high", "The immune system is under great stress", etc. This doesn't say much. Normality is no sign of health, and doctors usually just parrot whatever medical ideology they are subscribed to. They have zero spiritual understanding. Their understanding of human physiology is materialistic, crude, and linear. They have no sense of the subtle, energetic, psycho-somatic, or metaphysical aspects of human physiology.
</p>

<p>
	2) Don't fall into the trap of mistaking difficult emotional and physical sensations as "negative" or a sign of physical damage. It's very easy for a noob to misinterpret muscle burn at the gym as a sign of physical damage, for example. A little bit of pain can make the ego come up with all sorts of excuses. Your shadow and emotional trauma are wired deep into your mind, brain, and body. Releasing this deep trauma can feel painful, uncomfortable, difficult, scary, etc. Negative emotions arising is a sign of HEALTH, not sickness. It means the technique is working just as it should. This is called spiritual purification, and any serious spiritual technique has the potential to release very deep, painful, and scary thoughts and emotions. Facing your own lies, delusions, and ego-death is not rainbows and butterflies. With that said, you need to learn to intuit how much spiritual purification you can handle at a time. Going overboard is not good. Make sure you only bite off as much as you can chew.
</p>

<p>
	3) If 30 minutes of this techniques brings up a lot of physical challenges, pain, and emotions in you, then all that probably means is: you have a lot of emotional baggage to work through. For me, for example, 30 minutes of this technique feels intense, but there is no negativity, no pain, and little emotional baggage arising. For me, 30 minutes feels rejuvenating and empowering. It feels like an intense workout. Perhaps akin to running a marathon.
</p>

<p>
	4) Don't judge a spiritual technique unless you've actually done it with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
	5) Keep in mind, the ego is very sneaky. Any technique which directly threatens it, it will tend to demonize and reject. This is true of psychedelics and many other radical methods.
</p>

<p>
	6) The more effective a spiritual technique is, the more challenging it will be, and the less your ego will want to do it.
</p>

<p>
	7) Use common sense. Don't hurt yourself. Search your heart for whether this is healing or hurting you. As an example, after an intense workout at the gym, you should have a sense of whether you hurt yourself or strengthened yourself with that session.
</p>

<p>
	I am no doctor and this is not medical advice. You are 100% responsible for your own well-being. I like to practice hardcore and experimental techniques which may not be suitable for certain people. If you want to be 100% safe, then stick to 100% conventional materialist techniques (which basically means: no spirituality for you).
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality always involves some degree of danger and risk. You have to determine for yourself what you are comfortable with and how deep you're willing to go. If you think that meditation or yoga cannot get as intense as shamanic breathing, that's just because you've haven't really experienced hardcore meditation or yoga yet. And certainly this shamanic breathing is peanuts compared to a deep psychedelic session. I've done psychedelic sessions in which I've physically died. Good luck explaining that to a doctor.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, any technique that can produce ego-death or awakening is capable of eliciting in you deep fear and powerful emotions. Because are are literally facing your own death. That is no small thing.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality takes courage, but also intelligence. Be fearless, but also don't do anything stupid like physically harming yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You can call it hyperventilation if you want. But then by that logic you can also call awakening insanity. So what? You could also call weightlifting: tearing of your muscles. And you could call sex: exposure of your immune system to foreign diseases. And you could call eating a slice of pizza: ingesting cancer-causing poison.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's good. That's the only way really. You must doubt everything until nothing remains.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is like extreme skepticism taken to its ultimate conclusion, consuming everything, and even itself. Until only pure being remains.
</p>

<p>
	Trusting me is not what I ask you to do. I ask you to be skeptical of everything equally, especially of your self.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot trust anyone in this work. Not me, not any guru, not Buddha. You must discover what is true in your direct experience. Direct experience is all that really matters. My words are only here to motivate you to look more closely at your direct experience and question everything society has taught you.
</p>

<p>
	There are no authority figures. The truth cannot be spoken or proven to you. You must seek it out all alone.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you don't mistake my talking for truth. All the ideas I fill your mind with are NOT the truth!
</p>

<p>
	There are no guarantees, but Stan Grof has been teaching similar techniques for many years, with thousands of people participating. If it really damaged your brain, I'm pretty sure he would stop teaching it and people would have sued him long ago.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to know is to try it gradually for yourself. You will feel if it is hurting you or healing you. Just don't ask the question from a fear-based ego-mind perspective.
</p>

<p>
	I don't feel any damage from it. But you guys are all reporting unqiue experiences, so I can't guarantee your health.
</p>

<p>
	This is stuff that requires a willingness to experiment in a careful manner.
</p>

<p>
	What's nice about this techique is that you can make it as gradual as you like and stop at any time, unlike with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Hehe...
</p>

<p>
	You can't know until you achieve it. For all you know, everything I say could be a lie.
</p>

<p>
	Such is the nature of all breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot do research unless you are willing to assume the risk of deadends.
</p>

<p>
	Now you see why so few people discover the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. 1000 hours is actually a very small investment. You should be prepared to invest way more than that if you really care about knowing the origin of existence.

<p>
	There is a difference between people attacking you vs you "creating enemies." Enemies are a psychological creation of the ego-mind. People who attack you will of course always exist. 
</p>

<p>
	A shark can attack you while you are swimming in the ocean. But that does not make him your enemy, unless you hold him as such.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake would be to go on an ideological crusade against sharks. That's the lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of anyone who you follow in the media who is waging an ideological crusade against anything. Notice that that entire thing is a distraction from consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	All ideology is antithetical to truth and consciousness. And there are many very subtle forms of ideology floating around. We're not talking about fundamentalist religion here. The ideologies you should be worried about are much more subtle.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	All ideology is going to limit your growth.
</p>

<p>
	People such as Peterson and Sam Harris are actually ideologues. Which is why they develop sorts of cult followings. It's a modernized form of religion.
</p>

<p>
	People with strong opinions betray their lack of consciousness and understanding of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become, the less opinions and enemies you will have.
</p>

<p>
	Constant criticism, debating, and self-justifying are sure signs of low consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If an ideology or worldview appeals to you, you should be extra wary of it.

<p>
	There are hundreds of different ways to embody spirituality in your career aside from teaching.
</p>

<p>
	The reason your mind is stuck on teaching as the only option is because you're being lazy and not thinking outside the box.
</p>

<p>
	Monkey see, monkey do. Be more creative.

</p>

<p>
	The only strategy that matters is that you actually turn inside and look at your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	The rest is games.
</p>

<p>
	You can become enlightened sitting on your couch. If you would only discipline yourself and rivet your attention on: What am I?

	Next, Sadhguru teaches Trump to be spirtual.

<p>
	After failing to do so, Sadhguru goes mahasamdhi.

</p>

<p>
	Murder, rape, incest, drugs, genocide, racism... whatever. It is all part of reality and in fact an action of God.
</p>

<p>
	That is an extremely important point to understand. Until you understand this, you will never become deeply spiritual because you are not yet conscious of how your mind constructs these rules.
</p>

<p>
	If you reject evil, you in fact create evil. The solution to evil is to fully love it. The problem of exploitation is not solved with judgment or suppression, but LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	You want to realize and embody Divine Love. As your ego dissolves, what is left in its place is pure love for everything, and that's when your actions become truely moral. Morality is not about rules, it's about acting Good for no reason whatsoever, because it comes from your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Why would you want to use a girl for sex? Why not love her without necessarily marrying her?
</p>

<p>
	Sex is something you two can both enjoy. In fact, good sex is one of the greatest things a man can gift to a woman. Learn how to really please your girl in bed, and she will love you for it.
</p>

<p>
	Follow your heart, NOT rules from authority figures. Your heart is more powerful than all the rules in the world. When your heart is strong it allows you to overpower all of your selfish fearful egoic impulses.
</p>

<p>
	Rules are designed for heartless people.
</p>

<title>disproving absolute infintiy with thought experiment</title>

</p>

<p>
	1) The world is not nearly as rigid and predictable as you think. Take 2 tabs of LSD and see for yourself. Or just consider your dreams at night.
</p>

<p>
	2) Infinity includes an infinite number of predictable worlds. There is nothing you can think which is not found inside Infinity. You are hallucinating a predictable world. Which is no stranger than hallucinating an unpredictable world.
</p>

<p>
	3) Infinity is beyond all thought experiments. So all of this is just mental masturbation. Infinity is a brute fact. You cannot argue with what is. You can only become aware of it, or fail to do so. A brute fact does not hinge upon your thought experiments or reasons. Your mind is trying to make sense of God, and that will never work.
</p>

<p>
	If you still think God is something else than you, you haven't got it yet.
</p>

<p>
	It's best not to talk about God unless you have a direct experience of it.
</p>

<p>
	Quoting scriptures just doesn't cut it.
</p>

<p>
	Indeed, the only one you can worship or pray to is yourself. Whether you want to do so, it up to you.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate egotism is thinking God is Infinite, but that that infinity somehow excludes you.
</p>

	Depends on the teacher. Teachers are not all at the same level of realization.
</p>

<p>
	I've tried to get Ralston to try it but he declined and ridiculed it.

<p>
	Zen monasteries already have such a test. They require that you get a written letter of recommendation from a friend of the monastery, then you must come to their gate and beg to be admitted. They always deny you. You must sit at the gate steps for 24 hours while they keep rejecting you. Eventually they let you inside the gate. Then they put you in the storage closet for a week and tell you to sit there and meditate without talking. If you complete all that, then they accept you.
