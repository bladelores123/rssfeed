<p>
	You are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You have simply not awoken to what God or Love are.
</p>

<p>
	Emptiness is, ironically, just one facet of a much deeper thing which you have yet to access. You have not accessed it because self-inquiry is not a very effective tool to get there. And these various Buddhist and Neo-advaitan approaches which are popular today are fundamentally dogmatic and shallow. The realization of Emptiness and No-self is just the beginning of this work, which you have mistaken for the end.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious that you are God and that you are imagining all of physical reality, your awakening is skin deep. And if you are not conscious that Truth and Love are identical, again, your awakening is skin deep.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I say here on this matter I have personally verified and become directly conscious of. And so have others before me.
</p>

<p>
	I have told you guys many times, you don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not want to follow my teachings to God and Love, then this is not the right place for you. This is not something I will compromise on. There is enough ignorance around here as it is to have to deal with supposedly awake people who deny God and Love. You can fool yourself, but you ain't foolin me.
</p>

<p>
	God's eye is watching you.

<p>
	That could happen. But the psychedelic helps to purify the mind, body, and heart. It's an incremental process of purification.
</p>

<p>
	Self-deception is always a danger, psychedelic or no.

			It sounds like you only say it to be nice to those people that refuse to do them out of prejudice and fear, and to not make it sound like we need "drugs" to do this work. When in reality we are collectively in such a low state of consciousness that without psychedelics most of us are just gonna bang our heads against the wall for decades with little to show for it, and without even realizing we ain't getting anywhere.

<p>
	1) Things are under the universe's control. But luckily you are the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	2) Death is something you're imagining right now.
</p>

<p>
	3) Yes, you can break the chains of past and future by realizing that past and future are something you are imagining right now.
</p>

<p>
	Advanced alien beings might not have much of a government.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I don't imagine DMT machine elves have giant bureaucracies and empires. LOL. Although who knows?

<title>Where do psychopaths lie on the SP spectrum?</title>

Regression occurs when survival is severely threatened, but it should bounce back once the survival threat is handled.
</p>

<p>
	For an individual regression might happen if your business or marriage suddenly collapses.
</p>

<p>
	For a society regression might happen if there is a nuclear war or an economic depression.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how well established you are in a stage. If you're deep established regression will be much less likely than if you are just at the entry point of a stage.
</p>

<p>
	But generally speaking, a stage Yellow person is never going to regress to a stage Blue fundamentalist.
</p>

<p>
	This is an independent factor from Sprial Dynamics. I would call it a type, similar to masculine/feminine or personality types. A type should theoretically exist at any stage. But some types might be too limited to rise to the highest stages in practice. I doubt you can have a stage Yellow clinically retarded person.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that SD is a model which tracks averages. It will not address all the weird edge-cases of the human psyche. There are some serious freaks of nature who must be considered uniquely.

<p>
	Hard to say. He's definitely a very intelligent, highly developed stage Green at least. Probably some shades of Yellow, but also probably held back by the lack of knowing Spiral Dynamics and what Yellow even is.
</p>

<p>
	To really get into solid Yellow it's extremely important to learn Spiral Dynamics so one can explicitly see the whole Spiral at work in society.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Do you have any sense of whether it's possible to materialize a physical object through pure Will? Like a marble or a coin? And what is it that prevents this?
</p>

<p>
	I'm still trying to figure out the precise connection between Will and physical manifestation. I know that God's Will manifests all of physical reality, but I'm not clear why I don't have access to change it, since I am God -- what prevents this access?
</p>

<p>
	Any insights on that?
</p>

<p>
	And have you had any experience tapping into and shifting collective consciousness? Like the consciousness of the entire human species? Healing the species as a whole, for example.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	1) Were you born with paranormal abilities? Did you have them from a very early age? If not, how did you develop them?
</p>

<p>
	2) Do you believe that everyone can develop them? How do you account for the fact that most people have no paranormal experiences while paranormally gifted folks do?
</p>

<p>
	3) How do you understand the relationship between awakening and the paranormal? Clearly you can have one without the other. But also, how are they related?
</p>

<p>
	4) Why are some people so much more paranormally gifted than others?
</p>

<p>
	5) What is your understanding of psychic healing? How does it work? What makes it work? Why is it not always 100% effective? What is required to develop this ability to an effective level?
</p>

<p>
	6) List which paranormal abilities you've been able to personally validate and which ones not.
</p>

More people report bad trips on DPT. If you can find 5-MeO then it's probably better because it's more benevolent and clearer.
</p>

<p>
	But DPT is easier to find since its not explicitly banned in most countries.

<title>No advanced growth possible without psychedelics</title>

<p>
	Psychedics are not required.
</p>

<p>
	However, I must be honest with you guys. Most of you are so lost in your minds and so unserious about doing concentration practices and/or yoga, that you will never grasp the deepest things I talk about without psychedelics. The psychedelics are recommended because you are not motivated enough to do the manual legwork.
</p>

<p>
	If you refuse the psychedelic path, you must work your ass off doing concentration practices and yoga.
</p>

<p>
	This dabbling bullshit does not work and you will waste years of time.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is the most hardcore pursuit that man can undertake. Start treating it as such. It will be worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Or just forget about spirituality and do basic self-help. You need to be very clear with your intent. What do you want? Do you really want Truth? If you do you should be willing to sell your mother into slavery to get it.
</p>

	If you want serious answers to such questions then your best bet is to ask them on psychedilcs.

</p>

<p>
	The distinction between self/other is imaginary. So there are no individuals.
</p>

<p>
	This requires awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, LSD was showing you that. But you are not taking the contemplation seriously enough. Ask all your doubts when you are on LSD.

			Thanks for explaining, some of the things I already know. Yet, according to what we are taught here, tribes create dualities, it creates ego. The teaching of actualized.org contradicts that. Leo wants us to reach to a degree that we become one with the universe, yet the idea of tribes creates an illusion of duality. How is that any good?

<p>
	Nothing is good or bad. It's all relative. There are healthy and unhealthy aspects to tribes. The unhealthy aspect is that they tend to go to war with each other due to an "us vs them" worldview.

<p>
	Your logic here is so warped I don't even know where to begin.
</p>

<p>
	Why is it that self-inquiry or meditation cannot do the simplest thing like teach you to play the violin?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how absurd your logic is?
</p>

<p>
	1) Existential realizations have nothing to do with technical skill at manipulating the dream world. You are smart enough to know this.
</p>

<p>
	2) No therapist will teach you how to play a violin. This example is just absurd. It does a disservice to serious therapists to promise such results from therapy.

<p>
	Objective reality is all your imagination. Whatever God imagines is reality. If God imagines a chemical system, that chemical system will behave precisely how God imagines it behaves.

<p>
	It would be wise of you to actually watch my videos and to be on this forum to learn and not just teach, because your awakening and understanding of what reality is, is still surface level.
</p>

<p>
	You are not conscious yet of God or Love, and many other important facets of the Absolute. Nor have you had a psychedelic breakthrough, given the arguments you make.
</p>

<p>
	You are hallucinating this entire conversation. You are hallucinating your therapist. You are hallucinating chemistry. And you are even hallucinating psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	But you are NOT hallucinating God. You ARE God. The one who is hallucinating.
</p>

<p>
	All of your memories of having ever done psychotherapy are a hallucination. You're imagining it RIGHT NOW! Which is why it feels true. It's true because you (GOD) say it is.

People can have very different "brain chemistries" -- for lack of a better word, which is why people disagree so much about spiritual matters. It's not so simple as people merely being wrong or deluded. People are experiencing different territories and processing those territories in very different ways.

	Because there is no such thing as "the human brain". Each human brain/mind is unique. There can be a lot of overlap, but also a lot of divergence.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is way more complex than people make it out to be. It's easy to overlook this complexity when one sticks to a single orthodox school or teaching. But when you explore all schools, all teachings, all the edge cases, you start to see that it's not simple at all and there is no one path or single dimension to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than thinking of spirituality as a single axis, think of it as a 3 dimensional volume. And even that might be oversimplifying it.
</p>

<p>
	How often does one breathe in insects that this is a problem??
</p>

<p>
	Although, funny story, when I was a kid on vacation in Mexico, as I was playing with my GameBoy a moth flew straight into my ear and got stuck there. It was buzzing around in there. Had to find a doctor to get it out.

<p>
	It's not right to compare them with MDMA. I don't experience much elevation in heart rate from 5-MeO-DMT or DPT.
</p>

<p>
	But of course taking them daily is overkill. No one is going to take those substances for more than a few days in a row. It just gets too intense. The most I've done was 13 days in a row, and it's just way more nonduality than a human could want.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I think that's generally true, but this notion of "absolute" is quite problematic because in practice you can be in a state of little to no self-involvement and yet not be conscious of important facets of reality. I prefer to think of these as somewhat independent variables, with both being desirable and both being synergistic. Insight helps overcome defilements, and overcoming defilements helps attain deeper insight into the metaphysics of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Historically it just seems pretty clear that there were gurus and masters who have had very deep metaphysical insight yet still plenty of defilements.

<p>
	That's simply explained by the fact that you identified strongly with your cat but not your relatives.
</p>

<p>
	When you own a small cat it feels like your baby and so you feel much more responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the meaning you assign to objects and people is purely relative and imaginary. So if you get attached to a coffee table, you will mourn its loss.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	Insight is the thing that allows you to even know what a defilement is. And insight is what gets you free of defilement.
</p>

<p>
	Desire for more insight certainly can become neurotic if you turn it into a rat race sorta thing. But it don't have to be that way.

<p>
	LOL
</p>

<p>
	You know not what you speak.
</p>

<p>
	When psycho-analysis allows you to contact machine elves and communicate with them through multiple dimensions of  symbolism and telepathy, or to get direct downloads from the mind of God, or to pull demonic spirits out of a patient's body, then let's talk. Playing violins is kindergarten stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You do not understand how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	You do not even know what symbols truly are until you do some heavy tripping.
</p>

<p>
	To say that psychedelics are a "just a chemical" is a silly as saying that therapy is just a chemical. Everything is chemicals by that logic, including all symbols and your therapist. That therapist is just a soup of chemicals. This sort of selective, reductionist logic is a telltale sign of self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	I never said therapy doesn't work. Of course it works. But psychedelics work 1000x faster.
</p>

<p>
	If you have to ask "What do you mean by God?" you are not conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, God is Consciousness, but that doesn't mean you're conscious of God.
</p>

<p>
	God is God and cannot be reduced to any other insight. God is not anything else but God. The insight of God is very distinctive. You'll know it only when you become it.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't know what God is, just be honest with yourself that you don't know, rather than playing mind games.

	My body is materialized directly through God's Will. My body is the crystalized Will of God. You can become directly conscious of that. Since you are creating your body, otherwise you could not see it.

</p>

<p>
	But now reframe how you think of it. Rather than seeing this as "being all alone", see it as "I am in total union with all beings!!!"
</p>

<p>
	When you are making passionate love to a woman/man, are you alone? Yes! Because you two are one. But that just makes it better! That is the whole point! Not aloneness but Unity.
</p>

<p>
	YOU. ARE. UNITY! <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Aloneness as an absolute includes within it all forms of togetherness.
</p>

<p>
	What you must realize is that the pinacle of togetherness is aloneness.

</p>

<p>
	For example, are you conscious right now of how Universal Mind is materializing your physical body? I'd guess not. This requires a radical degree of consciousness than even most awakened people do not have.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I have become conscious of how I create every molecule in my own body. This realization has nothing to do with removing defilements.

<p>
	I have a more mystical answer for ya.
</p>

<p>
	Democracies go to war less simply because they have a higher level of collective consciousness. The more conscious one is, the less violent one is.
</p>

<p>
	A more mundane reason is trade. Democracies trade a lot more with each other. War disrupts trade and ruins economies. In a democratic country if the economy starts to sour the politicians will be immediately kicked out of office by angry voters.
</p>

<p>
	Trade is one of the strongest practical deterents to war.
</p>

<p>
	Why would you want to murder someone you're doing good business with?

</blockquote>

<p>
	In the end, everything is one.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you could equate Love and creativity. Creativity is a quality of Infinite Consciousness or Universal Mind -- which imagines all objects. Creativity is imagination. All creativity happens out of Love and for the sake of maximizing Love.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity is not seperate from Creation itself. They are one.
</p>

<p>
	The creativity you feel inside your mind is a tiny sliver of God's infnite creative capacity. God is literally using your mind to create through you. You are inspired by Spirit. You are In-spirit-ed. Your body is made out of spirit but your mind is also enspirited.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity is infinite and unlimited, giving rise to the infnite world of finite forms.

</p>

<p>
	SSRIs are not good for you. So you should have a plan for weaning off them regradless of psychedelics. You want your mind as free as possible for this work.
</p>

<p>
	I know weaning off them is hard, but see it as an investment into your future.
</p>

<p>
	For stuff like mild depression, psychedelics will be way more effective than antidepressants. Psychedelics will address the root cause of depression and will help you find peace.
</p>

<p>
	If you kick antidepressants you can do weekly trips and that will help you stay grounded.
</p>

<p>
	You can also experiment with microdosing LSD. Although I prefer large bi-weekly trips vs microdosing.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	So why not wean yourself off SSRIs first?
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is not merely that 5-MeO will reveal crazy truths.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that there can be a bad interaction between these two chemicals in your brain, causing the trip to turn very sour and possibly even lethal. If that happens your trip will spiral out of control. You will not be able to think your way out of it.
</p>

<p>
	When taking psychedelics you gotta consider possible interactions with other medicines very seriously. You don't know what kind of synergy could result.
</p>

<p>
	Do your research. And even then, I would not advise it.
</p>

	Yes but are you conscious of any of it? Or is it just a story in your head?

<p>
	I don't understand why you would be taking 5-MeO while on antidepressants.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is very radical. It will reveal shocking truths. Can you really handle that?
</p>

<p>
	Why are you on SSRIs to begin with?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I basically agree with all that except that even if all fear and all attachment is eliminated, there will still remain many degrees of insight into the fundamental nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is this: you could remove all those defilements but still be missing important existential sights such as What is Love? Or What is God? etc.

<title>First LSD Trips Trip Report</title>

<p>
	Sounds like your trips were very mild. Seems like you have a toleramce to LSD or weak blotter.
</p>

<p>
	Your intention is fine, if that's what you really want. But the real power of LSD will shine once you get over all your psychological needs and start setting metaphysical intentions. Like, What is reality?
</p>

<p>
	I would trip sitting up, not laying down.
</p>

<p>
	Tripping outdoors is tricky. Start by doing 10 or 20 trips indoors where you have full control of environment and isolation from disturbing people.
</p>

<title>Why are northern European countries so highly developed?</title>

<p>
	There are many theories.
</p>

<p>
	One of the them is that Europe is so highly develop precisely because it has been so competitive. So many different cultures clashing and fighting for over 4000 years. This constant battle and the two world wars lead to so much suffering that people learned to chill out.
</p>

<p>
	Competition creates technological advancement, which drives evolution of social and intellectual structures to sustain it.
</p>

<p>
	There is also a theory that it's harder to rule people in a hot environment. Hot environments are more conducive to tyrannical forms of rule. Not sure how much I buy that, but it's one theory.
</p>

<p>
	Europe also had abundant natural resources and it's easier for people to move horizontally across the global than vertically due to climate change on the vertical axis.
</p>

<p>
	These kinds of emotional reactions are a dead-giveaway of dogma. People react like that when they are defending an ideology. There is nothing logical about libertarian ideology despite any appeals they might make to logic. All the logic is a backwards-rationalization to justify one's dogmas.

<p>
	There are some really hilarious moments in that playlist. Just ignorance so thick all you can do is laugh.

			Well, for the reasons I laid out in my previous post, this makes zero sense.
		</p>

		<p>
			You’re commenting without actually understanding how or why therapy works. When a psychedelic enables someone to play the violin without ever having picked one up before, or learn German without studying, you can make these sorts of claims. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And I’ve had trips and have talked to people who have had many, many trips.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Talk therapy can be helpful but it is notoriously inefficient at resolving deep psychological issues. There have been studies done on this. People go to therapy for years and show only mild improvements. The studies and the anecdotal evidence backing up the effectiveness of psychedelics is simply too voluminous ignore.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with tripping is that it can be done in very different ways. Some ways are frivolous. And most people who do psychedelics are not serious, they are dicking around. I've read so many idiotic trip reports that it amazes me how often people misuse psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If psychedelics were widely available and people where taught to properly use them, I'd guess that 50% of therapists would be out of a job.
</p>

<p>
	There are aspects of your psyche which can be accessed on psychedelics which you will never access sober or with a therapist. And I don't believe there is anything a therapist can help you access which a psychedelic cannot.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you've done psychedelics but it does not seem like you've realized their full potential yet. Perhaps because you were already fairly pure before taking them. Or simply because you have some sort of natural tolerance to them (as some people do).
</p>

<p>
	I'm not really saying anything bad about therapy. It think it's a good method for some. But I just don't see how it can match the power of psychedelics. Verbal analysis of psychological issues is simply very indirect. It's the same problem as trying to verbally talk someone into awakening. It's highly inefficient.
</p>

<p>
	What kind of psychotherapy allows someone to play the violin without practice????
</p>

<p>
	Let me put it this way: if I had a daughter who was raped, I would not a trust a psychotherapist to heal her trauma. I would send her to do some psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	My ex-girlfriend was an alcoholic and had panic attacks because she was sexually abused in her teenage years. She went to therapy for years. She was still extremely dysfunctional to the point where I could no longer be in relationship with her. She could not handle honesty at all and she was extremely insecure. If she went to therapy for another 5 years, I doubt it would solve her issues.
</p>

<p>
	There is a reason why AA was founded on LSD. AA minus the LSD is much less effective.
</p>

<p>
	Seriously contemplate: What is the value of feminism? Why did this social movement arise? What legitimate problems has it addressed and what legitimate problems is it still addressing?
</p>

<p>
	Get curious about studying it. Seek to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	This will put you in the right frame of mind.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that women are not asking for more rights. They are asking for decent and fair treatment and for respect of the feminine way of life.
</p>

<p>
	This is not merely an issue of strictly equal legal rights. This is an issue of an under-representation of feminine values in mainstream culture and centers of power. Women have a unique way of experiencing the world and dealing with problems. As men, and as a hyper-macho society, we can benefit greatly from adopting some of those ways. All without becoming emasculated. We can benefit a lot from feminine leaders. Not just women who act like cold bossy men. But truly feminine leadership style.
</p>

<p>
	This is in fact one of the easiest ways to reduce violence around the world: put more women in charge.
</p>

	Violence is actually not the opposite of love or awakening.

<p>
	Violence happens precisely because it is part of the Ultimate Good. Some things cannot be resolved other than through violence. That's the paradox.

<p>
	The Hitler issue was resolved by fighting the devil head-on, not by Spiral Dynamicing him. My point is that no amount Spiral Dynamics or Integral Theory would have resolved that issue, and that it might have made it worse. No everyone can be negotiated with. Negotiation has certain prerequisites.

<p>
	Yes, but also don't expect it to do all the work for you. You still gotta take responsibility for your bad habits.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just going to erase an addiction without any effort from you.

	Distinguish between low consciousness and high consciousness desires, survival needs vs being needs.

<p>
	It begins as armchair philosophy, and as you become more serious, it turns into true contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is no clear line between the two, as that would be just another duality.

<p>
	I suspect this is true.
</p>

<p>
	I have not verified it conclusively because I've never done it orally.
</p>

<p>
	But the plugged experience is so intense and different than typical 4-AcO-DMT trip reports that I assume plugging it really is different.
</p>

<p>
	It's like the most intense version of mushrooms. I hesitate to take that shit again. It's like 5 hours of nonstop mindfuckery.

			This causes a high degree of cognitive dissonance in the newly awakened person. Which can be solved by clinging onto one’s seeing and refusing to acknowledge one’s cognitive dissonance.

	The deepest trip I've ever had in my life came from plugging 4-AcO-DMT. It was so nondual that you wouldn't believe. I stopped being able to tell that I was human.

	But of course that's because I've done many trips to build myself up to this point.
