<p>
	It obviously is.

<p>
	Why else would a right wing group create entertainment media? They ain't doing it for the art nor the money.

<p>
	I don't know what their big picture understanding is, but I'm pretty sure it's wrong because such people don't understand what science is.
</p>

<p>
	"A very scientific" POV will always fail.
</p>

<p>
	If someone starts a conversation about reality with the phrase, "I'm going to be very scientific..." you already know they fucked up.
</p>

<p>
	What they're doing is good, but it will be limited. Ultimate reality cannot be understood scientifically.

			You seem to have a great deal of different kinds of knowledge, but I would say you lack one in this department. That's probably the reason why you never invested in crypto in the first place (I just assume that you haven't) and you might also think that you missed the boat on top of that.

	The mental energy you guys are wasting on this could have been invested in actually making yourself a massive value provider.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of distractions if you truly care about becoming wealthy.
</p>

<p>
	People who invest in crypto are like vultures fighting for scraps of road-kill while while the lion goes on to hunt the real game.

<p>
	Very few people are like that.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that the type of person you are when you enter pickup is the type of person you are whiling doing pickup and while dating.
</p>

<p>
	If a sociopath enters pickup, he will be a sociopath all throughout. And pickup is appealing for many narcissists and sociopaths. But that's far from the majority of guys. Most guys are not that way. What you see in the news is the most extreme cases. You don't hear about the thousands of guys just using pickup to get a girlfriend. The news will show you pickup guys who are also murderers.

<title>How to deal with a situation where nobody wants you anymore?</title>

<p>
	You can start by realizing that "nobody wants me" is a false gross generalization.
</p>

<p>
	There are 8 billion people on Earth. If your family doesn't want you, that's nowhere close to nobody wants you. Millions of people still want you.
</p>

<p>
	Also, escaping a toxic family is a great thing.

<p>
	The only thing Big Tech enforces are its ToS, they don't care about conservative opinions unless they violate ToS.
</p>

<p>
	Tim Pool will never get deleted unless he violates the ToS multiple times. Which is true for every liberal as well.
</p>

<p>
	If I violate YT's ToS, I will get deleted. And that's correct.
</p>

<p>
	It just so happens that liberals don't violate ToS as often as conservatives because conservatives are lower consciousness. Conservatives are more racist, homophobic, bullying, conspiratorial, and violent. Which is why they get kicked off social media more often.

<p>
	Dude, you're horribly misusing the advice.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do difficult things just for the sake of it. Follow your passions. Stop doing things you have no passion in.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, life will present you with plenty of challenges once you're following your passions.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	No. Some girls are just lazy, timid, and inexperienced. It's not a lack of love. Good sex, like all things, requires skills and training. And few girls are interested in training because they expect to coast by on "love".
</p>

<p>
	"As long as we have love, the sex must be good, right?" Wrong.

<p>
	Yes, girls who are too passive are not as hot as those who are a bit sexually aggressive but still willing to be feminine and ultimately surrender.
</p>

<p>
	A passive dead fish is not the ideal. In general I find women to be too lazy in bed, putting in too little effort -- and that is not cool. Such girls are not worth keeping.
</p>

<p>
	Be proactive in the bedroom and you will retain more guys.

<p>
	Be careful with your generalizations. The police did not do nothing. That video shows one cop -- who seems to have been MAGA sympathetic. This does not mean all, or even most, of the police were. Most police did not do that, they fought off MAGA while they could.
</p>

<p>
	What you're doing with police here is the same as if you saw one black guy in the Capitol and then concluded: "All black guys are traitors." No. Just that one guy is.

<p>
	Shapiro's foray into filmmaking is obviously driven by ideology. He's taking a page from the Dennis Prager propaganda strategy.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't see this, well, I can't help you.
</p>

<p>
	Do some Hollywood movies have political messages and could also be considered propaganda? Sure. But most Hollywood filmmakers are no there to push an ideology, and even when they do, the messages they put into their movies are higher quality stage Green ones.

<p>
	To be clear, many guys who get into pickup abuse it and don't give a shit about women.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just saying that pickup can be done in more conscious ways and the fact is that it works and it's not going away because men struggle with getting laid more than ever. So my solution is to make pickup more conscious and healthy.

			If a man feels like, "I have to have x,y,z qualities to attract women", then he will often write over his natural qualities in favor of whatever 'x,y,z' qualities are.

		<p>
			This is what i meant. You can pick up on this energy of men wearing an armor where they try to embody qualities that aren't necessarily a natural expression of their core personality. But because they feel like they need these techniques to be attractive to women, they hide themselves away underneath an armor of masculine virtue.

<p>
	It's sort of like you're saying, don't practice piano because you're not perfect and natural at it.
</p>

<p>
	Guys need a mechanism for getting better with women. Pickup is that mechanism. You can criticize it, but then you need to invent a better mechanism that actually works for guys.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that what women think will work for guys -- does not work! It's like telling a lion to eat tofu. Sounds nice in theory but doesn't work in practice because he's a lion.

			I guess I would be a bit surprised if there was a genuine deep bonding there. I know I couldn't really open up to a man in that head-space, as it would feel emotionally unsafe and frustrating because he wouldn't be able to see me as a person beyond his own agenda.

</blockquote>

<p>
	"That headspace" << See, you got some negative view of pickup as some fakery.
</p>

<p>
	You're framing this as though pickup teaches men to be dogs. But the reality is that most men are dogs whether they learn pickup or not. Pickup doesn't put the dog in the man. His genetics do that.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of being good with women is that you make them feel more intimate and safe then untrained guys. The reason PUAs get laid so much more is because they make women feel more intimacy and deeper intimacy than otherwise. Intimacy is something that a guy can learn to create quickly.

<p>
	I don't expect women to understand pickup.
</p>

<p>
	It's an incorrect view that pickup cannot lead to deep bonding experiences. All pickup does is increase your odds of getting laid. Where that goes from there is up to you. You can use it to get married or whatever.

<p>
	We'll just have to agree to disagree.
</p>

<p>
	I have used pickup skills to create deep bonding experiences. Of course not everything is a deep bonding experience, nor should it be.
</p>

<p>
	The average guy who has zero training will not know how to create deep bonding experiences. Which is your typical guy who you ladies complain about. He has no idea how to do deep sex or how to please you.
</p>

<p>
	Getting good with women requires training for most men. And training comes with lots of failure and trial and error.

<p>
	That's because I sucked and was training to overcome serious social anxiety and inexperience, and pickup has a very steep initial learning curve. My conversion rate today would be much higher.
</p>

<p>
	But see, you don't care about such things as learning curves.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't forget, most hot girls have boyfriends. Hard to have a high conversion rate when you are going for hot girls and many of them are taken because they get approached all the time and have so many options.

	No, that draws the boundary of concern far too narrowly.

	Women don't even understand the burden and challenge of having to approach. It's a huge burden that women take completely for granted. I wish I never had to approach. You think guys like to approach??? I would rather get kicked in the dick.

<p>
	Yes, in a sense. I don't claim to fully understand women. There's much I don't understand so I try to be curious about your POV.
</p>

<p>
	For example, when I trip on psychedelics I will actually try to feel what it's like to be a woman.
</p>

<p>
	But also, I am biased, and sometimes I just don't give a fuck about the woman's agenda when I got my own to worry about. After all, no one will concern themselves with meeting my needs other than myself. Which is why selfishness exists. Selfishness is not some evil force. Selfishness is absolutely necessary for selflessness. In fact, selfishness is identical to selflessness in the absolute sense.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course it's possible. They just rarely want to. Women have little interest in sitting down and logically analyzing and deconstructing their attraction. Because it ruins the illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Girls have a vague right-idea of what attracts them: humor, confidence, masculine energy, leadership, strength, dominance, charisma, social status, authenticity, etc. But they will not tell you how to create these things. They just expect you to naturally have it and never work to create it. They tend to think that if you work to create it you are doing something wrong, unnatural, and cheating. And that's because plenty of guys do fake those things to lure in women, and of course women hate that because they don't want the fake thing, they want the real thing. But they have no interest in knowing what it takes to create the real thing. They just know they want it. They don't care how the guys gets it. And they are not very tolerant or understanding of the guy's struggle/attempts to create it. The attempts are framed as fakery and cheating -- not genuine desire for growth. So when a guy fucks up the pickup, the girl doesn't think, "Oh, he's doing this to try to become a better man but he failed here", she thinks, "This guy is a fake creep loser trying to get in my pants. This is gross and horrible".
</p>

<p>
	They want the sausage but they don't want to know how its made.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is highly self-biased, because it's designed to satisfy the male survival agenda. No doubt about that. Exactly the same way that female dating and relationship advice is highly self-biased. Women do not care about a pure understanding men and their sexual needs. Women only care about their female needs.
</p>

<p>
	No woman I've ever met has ever cared about understanding pickup. And hence no woman does. Because in general, no human cares about a pure understanding of anything. Human desires for understanding are usually highly limited to their personal survival needs. Hence the whole tragedy of mankind.

			When male dating coaches and PUAs tell their audiences that you can't ask women about what they attracts them (i.e. Don't ask a fish how to catch them), it is just for business purposes. Otherwise, female dating coaches would put them out of business.

<p>
	No. I'm not a dating coach and I don't earn any money coaching people on pickup stuff. But I can tell you from lots of personal experience that a woman will never give a guy good advice for how to attract and sleep with women. Because attraction is deeply counter-intuitive and women themselves are deeply in denial and unconscious of what attracts them and what makes them open their legs.
</p>

<p>
	Women love to tell themselves all sorts of fantasies about what they are attracted to, when in fact they are attracted to the opposite. They will say stuff like, "Just be yourself. Just be a nice guy." and then they end up sleeping with the biggest asshole in the room.
</p>

<p>
	A fish cannot tell you how to catch it because it has not invested any time and has no experience catching itself. The first doesn't actually know what catches it. And even if it did, it would not be in the fish's survival interest to disclose such information.

			And when PUAs say that these techniques work on all women, this is likewise a marketing strategy. It's not as appealing to say that 25% of women will be open to these techniques. It's much more effective to say "These techniques are universal and CAN work on every woman."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Just because a thing works on all women does not mean you will sleep with every woman. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	Your 25% number is just something you invented to make yourself feel good. Women love to believe, "That pickup stuff will never work on me. I'm too smart for that. It only works on dumb girls with low self-esteem." Except you're not too smart for it because you are attracted to certain things and if a guy meets that criteria you will be attracted to him regardless of how he got there. You don't care about how he got there. You don't know how he got there. All you see is the end result.

<p>
	People are attracted to different styles and flavors. Hence there cannot ever be a 100% conversion rate. Pickup takes all this into account. You are not meant to mesh well with all guys.

<p>
	It does not matter what you've seen before -- a high-value guy is a high-value guy. You're assuming the guy is faking his value, but I'm talking about a guy who is not faking his value.

<p>
	This is like a guy saying, "Well, I've seen big tits before, so big tits won't work on me again." They work every time. And they even work when they are fake or some push-up bra.

			That's why your conversion rate is low. You have to play the numbers game because it doesn't work on every woman. And it isn't just the fact that you personally won't appeal to every woman... the techniques you use won't work on the majority of the female population. They only work on a percentage of the female population.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No. The conversion rate is low because all dating is a numbers game. You play this numbers game your entire life. When you go on Tinder, there is your numbers game.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course I personally won't appeal to every woman. In fact, this is a common mistake newbie PUAs make -- trying to appeal to every woman. A guy will be much more successful with women if he aims for 33% of women hating him, 33% of women being indifferent to him, and 33% of women loving him. This polarization is key. Just like in business you must appeal to a specific audience, not everyone under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are the one who is setting up this 100% conversion rate standard. But that's a strawman. Nowhere near this standard needs to be met. Baseball is not discredited simply because no one has a 100% bating average. And baseball bating principles don't merely work on 25% of the balls, they work on 100% of the balls. But you will never hit 100%.

<p>
	So, Ben Shaprio is branching out into the Hollywood sector by making right-wing propaganda entertainment films.
</p>

<p>
	His first film: Die Hard In School -- where the conservative hunter girl goes John McClane on a couple of high school shooters.
</p>

<p>
	Message of the film: If you are in a mass shooting situation, don't be a pussy and take on the mass shooters one-on-one, Die Hard style, by using the conservative gun skillz your pappy taught you. Play out your gun fantasies, be a hero, save the day!
</p>

<p>
	You can't make this shit up, but apparently Ben Shapiro and his ilk did.

Given your limited picture of what it is, your perspective is valid. But pickup is not what you think it is. It's very hard to understand it from a woman's POV.
</p>

<p>
	All women are attracted to confident, humorous, outgoing, and strong men who can stimulate them emotionally and are good leaders. The function of pickup when done properly is to teach guys how to become such men. It's not about pickup lines.

<p>
	This is not correct. All women are attracted to the principles that pickup teaches. 100% -- assuming they are straight and feminine. It just needs to be executed naturally, and of course this still don't not guarantee some 100% conversion rate. Conversation rate in all things is usually low. It's silly to expect to sleep with 100% of people you meet. Conversion rate in most sales situations is <1%.
</p>

<p>
	Of course pickup is NOT a pure understanding of women. It's an understanding of how to attract and sleep with women. These are two very different things.

<p>
	Nobody will ever give you marketing. It's your job to create it. That's what business <u>is</u>!
</p>

<p>
	Let go of the gurus and books and start using your brain creatively and independently.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, you can find hundreds of different courses/seminars/workshops on marketing. They can teach you principles and give you ideas, but none of them will do the trick for you. Only you can do the trick.
</p>

<p>
	The right marketing plan is worth more than the entire business. To expect someone to hand you a marketing plan is like expecting someone to gift you a gold mine.
</p>

<p>
	Just as an example, do you know what AirBnB's marketing plan was? They created a horde of bots to spam Craiglist to steal all their rental clients and lure them over to AirBnB. Without this plan AirBnB would not exist today. AirBnB is now valued at $101 billion. That marketing plan was worth $101 billion dollars. No book will tell you how to do that.

</blockquote>

<p>
	What do you mean, "returns just not there"?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously when you are starting a business you must do a rapid proof of profit. If you can't make sales happen, you've got nothing. So whatever you're creating must have a way of making sales. And you need a realistic marketing plan to get those sales because sales never happen automagically. Sales require intense and calculated marketing.
</p>

<p>
	So basically, all business boils down to a marketing problem. You need to deeply study and understand the marketing behind whatever product or service you're creating/selling. No marketing, no business.
</p>

<p>
	If returns aren't there, adjust your product/service and/or marketing plan to better match what people want and are willing to pay for. You can't just create things that only you want, you have to always keep an eye on what people want/need.
</p>

<p>
	The surest way to start a successful biz is to find a deep emotional need in the market which is under-served by other businesses. For example, you know guys are insecure about their dick size. Invent a product/service that will cure that, either by growing their dick or by eliminating that insecurity forever. Just a cliche example. You must be more creative than that.
</p>

<p>
	To launch a biz your business ideas must be highly pragmatic, not idealistic. Idealism rarely produces profit.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you want to generate serious money look into business, not stocks.
</p>

<p>
	Your whole approach to money is wrong. You are looking for ways to leech money, when you should be looking for ways to become a massive value provider. If you want to become wealthy make yourself a massive value provider and don't even think about leeching value.

</p>

<p>
	But self-esteem problems are typically much broader and deeper than that. And those won't be automagically fixed.
</p>

<p>
	Getting laid helps with curing crippling neediness. Which is good for getting more girls. So it's an upward spiral. But if you got trauma-based self-esteem issues, those will probably not be fixed.

	This just makes him more dumb. Actually, plenty of Trumpists like Bernie Sanders. Because they don't look at policy, they look at anti-establishment vibes, his working-class style, and they are ignorant and confused.
</p>

<p>
	If you carefully questioned and polled most Trumpists, they would be in favor of progressive policies.

	Your logic is a silly as telling me that you'll come back several months later to see who was right about red or black at the roulette tablet.

<p>
	I am not saying BitCoin will go up or go down. I'm saying no one has a clue. Coming back months later and showing me your money proves absolutely nothing.

<p>
	Sorry, I know this isn't exactly high-brow of me, but hey, sometimes there's value in showing how delusionally wrong a YT pundit is.
</p>

<p>
	One of the problems with conservative pundits is how often they are wrong and how easily they get away with it and just continue acting as though it's all good. There needs to be accounting for one's bad predictions and takes because that's ultimately how we adjudicate between worse and better worldviews. Conservatives are masters at avoiding this empirical accounting because it rarely favors their worldview.

	3 second rule: When you see a hot girl, count to three and start walking over to her even if you have no clue what you'll say.
</p>

<p>
	Try a very authentic and natural opener like: "Excuse me. Hi. I just saw you 3 seconds ago and forced myself to come over her and talk to you. I didn't want to but I knew I had to."
</p>

<p>
	Let your opener just be a straight narration of how you feel or think. And don't forget to fucking smile as you open.

<p>
	Deplatforming toxic people like Alex Jones and Trump definitely works to minimize their message. It's hard to argue with that.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest problems with Trump was that he was given so much free media. Billions in free media. This much air time spread a lot of toxicity and took attention away from important issues.
</p>

<p>
	The problem I see is that these platforms might decide to re-platform him in the future. I'm skeptical that these will truly be lifetime bans.

	Of course he might have some Blue, but he's not centered at Blue. He's not the nationalistic sort. He's more of a globalist neoliberal type. Many in Russia felt he was too "soft" and betrayed Russian nationalism. But he also wasn't a pure pragmatist and materialistic businessman type. He has a more compassionate stance. Which to me seems Greenish.
</p>

<p>
	He was ahead of his time and his peers.
</p>

<p>
	Then again I haven't read too much about him. Just going by first glance interviews I've seen of him.

<p>
	How does it know how to do that?

<p>
	Because it <u>is</u> Love.

	All this stuff is just grist for the self-bias-awareness mill.
</p>

<p>
	The reason all these dating disagreements exist is because both sides are just acting out their agenda, and the agendas are contradictory because one comes at the expense of the other.

			this is speculation. you're conflating the future potential of what the technology/crypto currency will be and bitcoin. I said it in my earlier post. I am not talking about the potential of crypto. I am talking about bitcoin specifically. who knows what crypto and the subsequent systems around it will be in 50 years. in the mean time though all these ploys for it are pump and dumps with winners and losers.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	Markets are forward-looking. People are looking to get in on the ground floor of an important new technology. BitCoin is not some future potential. It is already here. If the full potential of digital currency is ever realized it will be worth trillions. But it is not clear how or when this potential will be realized. BitCoin may not be able to do it.

<p>
	Real estate keeps its value very well and even adjusts for inflation because everyone needs it. Crashes are temporary and nowhere near as bad as a BitCoin crash. A BitCoin crash would wipe out your investment in one week. Real estate will never do that. At most it crashes 20-30%, and then rebounds after a few years and such crashes happen once a decade or less.

</p>

<p>
	The difference is that this is not a genetically baked in thing. Development can be changed. So this is not like race-IQ garbage.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone understands that African countries are less developed than European countries. No big surprise here. Same goes for South American countries and Middle Eastern countries.
</p>

<p>
	So in general, immigrants will have lower levels of cognitive development than the place they immigrate to.

<p>
	No, BitCoin has way more merit and value than stupid tulips.
</p>

<p>
	BitCoin can serve as a global digital gold reserve. That's a pretty big deal.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it can still be over-hyped, but it does have merit. We just don't know what it's ultimate value will settle at and which crypto coin will come out on top.

It's about ideology and level of cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	This is a common mistake made by media pundits. They mistakenly attribute cognitive development problems to lower class problems. That's because they have no idea about cognitive development and they need some kind of narrative to explain it.
</p>

<p>
	Progressive populists make a similar mistake. They believe the poor working class will love socialism. And then they are surprised to learn that isn't true because much of the poor working class is uneducated and low in cognitive development so they vote for MAGA and Biden.
</p>

<p>
	Voting progressive requires high cognitive development -- which is why progressives rarely win elections.
</p>

<p>
	This is also the reason why plenty of blacks, asians, and latinos vote MAGA. It's not about race, it's about cognitive development. Many latinos have low cognitive development given the underdeveloped countries they hail from.
</p>

<p>
	Politics is a culture/values war, not a policy debate. Conservatives understand this while progressives do not. Which is why conservatives disproportionately win. Its as if progressives are trying to pick up girls by logically convincing them how good of a mate they would be, while conservatives pick up girls by being funny, exciting, and dramatic. The conservatives will get laid way more.

	Not nearly good enough because that is a tiny island within a capitalist system. That is not the same as replacing the whole capitalist system in which that island survives.

But 70mgs for me is a solid trip. But I'm much more sensitive to all psychedelics than normal folk so you might need double that.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah... plugging 100mg+ doesn't feel so nice.
</p>

<p>
	You could always vape it. But be careful. DPT is no joke.

I have a question for you regarding the shift in my perception I've had since about mid December. Since then I have no longer felt encapsulated by an ego structure, my perception and operating in life has been in a place of unmoving fundamental beingness. I see everything even just existing is the most profound thing in all of existence and yet it is all very rooted and mundane. Life now feels like a beautiful dream. In your experience of the intricacies and dynamics of awakening what do you have to say regarding this?

			Would you extend that critique to market socialism as well (where workers own and control their workplaces democratically but still use a market based system to produce and distribute goods)? It seems like Market Socialism could offers a potential avenue to a workable system that blends positive aspects of both socialism and capitalism.

<p>
	Point to examples of it working in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	And if you can't find examples then the burden is on you to articulate in painful detail how your system will work and handle all the complexities that the current system handles.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to see Social Democracy working. Much harder to see pure socialism working.

	There are far more problems for socialism than outside meddling.
</p>

<p>
	Every socialist system eventually had to revert back to capitalism to meet the needs of the people.

<p>
	But I know plenty of PUAs like to go out like thirsty wolves and it gets them good results. Beast mode does work.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to go out and approach regardless of anything.

			Please try to entertain the idea that Iraqi societies are fucked up, and inherently incompatible and can't be a part of international family. This will at least make you see the imperfections that a society like Iraq, lived through at least 70 years of political turbulence have. Cuz when you only cast the blame on American politics, then it is like assuming that they are dealing with perfectly healthy nations, which is not the case.

<p>
	Iraq is deeply mired in stage Purple, Red, and barely Blue levels of development. So course it seems like they are not at the same level as Europe and the like. And course America's invasion alone was not their only problem. It poured fuel on the internal problems they had that now boil over without the lid of Saddam keeping them suppressed. And these problems had to be dealt with one way or other, regardless of invasion. It was an impossible situation.

<p>
	Once it's visible to you, it will be visible to everybody, and the price of BitCoin will crash immediately.
</p>

<p>
	Digital currency is such a brand new thing that likely none of the current technologies will be the final form of it. They all have terrible downsides. I foresee a new future coin that solves all the tech problems and downsides. It must be fast, private, stable, secure, un-fuck-with-able, usable as easily as a debit card, etc.

<p>
	The biggest threat to BitCoin is some other, newer, better crypto coin -- which could render BitCoin worthless.
</p>

<p>
	There is no guarantee at all that the world will settle on BitCoin as the crypto standard of choice. And that is what you're gambling on when you "invest" in BitCoin.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is all in the details.

<p>
	One thing you will notice is how biased, naive, foolish, and judgmental Green people are.
</p>

<p>
	A Green person is not capable of truly understanding a stage Blue or Orange person, nor do they have any such interest. They are mostly interested in blaming them while advancing a Green worldview as though it were absolute, and they will judge anyone who disagrees with them as below Green.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Pumping and dumping. Supply is not an absolute thing. Supply and demand form a complex interconnected relationship.
</p>

<p>
	If I can go on Facebook or YT and hype up BitCoin as the greatest thing ever, people start to buy it en masse, and this effectively manipulates the price by manipulating supply and demand. The absolute number of coins never needs to change for this manipulation to take place and lose you all your money.
</p>

<p>
	In the end what affects you is not the absolute number of coins but their relative value to when you purchased and sold them. It doesn't matter what the underlying value is, if you purchase and sell at the wrong time you will lose money. And it's very easy to purchase and sell at the wrong times. So this idea that BitCoin is a "sure thing" is just a fantasy.

<p>
	To be clear, I never said BitCoin is a hoax. It's not a hoax. It has legit merit and it might even come to replace something like gold some day. I'm just saying no one here knows its true value, and you cannot just assume that its value will keep going up.

<p>
	That's true, except you can manipulate the BitCoin supply and market extremely easily, which happens all the time, making BitCoin so volitile it is basically unusable as actual currency. And there are 100s of competing crypto currencies and you have no clue which one will end up on top in the end and which ones will become worthless.
</p>

<p>
	BitCoin's privacy features have virtually evaporated now since all exchanges require ID verification and are monitored by the feds.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most important fratures of a currency is to be stable, which crypto is not.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	Think deeper about what money means.
</p>

<p>
	To hold a $1 million dollars means that you can not work for several years while others serve you.
</p>

<p>
	That is wage slavery. The slavery is baked directly into the dollars. The only reason a million dollars seems like a lot is because it means a dozen people are forced to serve you.
</p>

<p>
	If wage slavery didn't exist your million dollars would not be worth so much.

<p>
	There is nothing special about anyone. Or, to say the same thing, everyone is equally special.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is bullshitting itself whenever it feels that one thing is more special than any other. That is ego in a nutshell. But you can't stop doing it or you'll die. So here we are, bullshitting each other.
</p>

<p>
	And now you understand all of human life, especially dating and relationships. It's all 100% pure bullshit which is why it's so unstable.

			Wasn't arranged marriage the norm since ever until very recently? Humanity were mostly tribes, if you tried to pick up a girl from another tribe they would cut your dick off. That is why most men are afraid of pickup I think. <img alt=":ph34r:" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ph34r.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ph34r@2x.png 2x" title=":ph34r:" width="20" />

<p>
	Players have been around since forever.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to go to another tribe to pick up girls. Although of course that happened too.
</p>

<p>
	You know the first thing that Magellan's men did after they landed on foreign shores in South America after weeks at sea? Go pick up the native chicks. To put that into perspective, that's like astronauts landing on Mars and the first thing they do is go looking for alien girls to fuck.

<p>
	When women get turned on by male stripper shows, it's not just the body. It's the emotional state the entire show puts her in. When girls go to male strip shows it's usually a pack of girls and they all drink and dance and get have fun together. This pumps up their state and then they get horny from that and want dick.
</p>

<p>
	Pumping up her emotional state is the magic key. No woman will ever fuck you logically. If you cannot get her out of logic-mode, she will say No.

	It's cringe in your eyes right now because you're in a cold and logical state.

	The dick pic can work as long as you already got her really turned on emotionally.

<p>

			However, I am now starting to think maybe women in general are not turned on sexually to any significant degree by any male visual aesthetics. Sometimes I wonder if there was even any point in me working so hard to look fit and masculine. Do women even masturbate to guys who look hot to them?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Haha
</p>

<p>
	Women are not sexually aroused in the same way as guys. They are not aroused by visuals alone. They are attracted to powerful personality and presence and leadership. They are attracted when the guy is good at pumping up her emotional state and making her feel like a girl. Women are emotional creatures. A photo of the biggest dick in the world will not make her excited. You must pump up her emotional state first. The silent James Bond approach will not get you laid. You must be chatty, playful, and extroverted. You need to play with her.
</p>

<p>
	Your looks are a great advantage -- they get your foot in the door -- but getting your foot in the door is NOT closing. Learning to close makes or breaks your whole lay count. If you are good-looking but have no clue how to close, you'll get laid less then ugly guys who know how to close.
</p>

<p>
	Right now it's like you own a Ferrari but have no clue how to drive. The Ferrari is a fast car that will beat a Toyota, but if I know how to drive my Toyota and you have no clue how to drive your Ferrari, I will beat you every time.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to understand what turns on women, go to Walmart and buy a romance novel. Read it. That's is porn for women. Women are turned on mentally, not visually.
</p>

<p>
	Also... attraction is also not seduction. You can get attraction pretty easy but then you must lay on the seduction until she's horny. A women does not get horny instantly like a guy. You need to guide her into it and manage all the logistics so sex can happen. You absolutely cannot count on women to handle the logistics. Learning to handle logistics like a champ is the #1 key to getting laid consistently.
</p>

<p>
	It's the logistics, stupid <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	All game boils down to two things: playful leading. Everything else is an unpacking of those two things. If you can't be playful and you can't lead, your game sucks, and so your chances of getting laid become extremely low.
</p>

	Once Trump is out of office for 90 days, and he's nowhere to be seen on social media, the Republicans <strong><u>might</u></strong> muster enough spine to convict him as the cost of doing so becomes negligible.
</p>

<p>
	No matter what, the Republicans are going to be forced to move forward without Trump. There is no way Trump will run and win again. So they need a new survival strategy.

<p>
	Even when the gov is controlled by Republicans, we still have regulations in place at the federal level against racism, hate speech, terrorist conspiracies, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Once the government's policies on policing online platforms are voted upon and set it place, they will be more strict than what we have now, where Twitter, Facebook, and YT are pretty lax with enforcement because they don't want to be labeled censors.
</p>

<p>
	Once online norms are established at the federal level, democratically, there will be much less squeamishness in enforcing them. The problem right now for these platforms is that they have no democratically established rules to rely on. So they must make up their own rules which don't have universal buy-in. This will change in the future.
</p>
