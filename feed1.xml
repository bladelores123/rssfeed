	In practice maintaining a harem requires a lot of lying and manipulating. The girls are never satisfied being in the harem long-term. Girls inevitably drop out and must be replaced with new ones. But it's easy for the guy to justify it to himself because he's getting laid so much.

<p>
	The average person has zero chance of awakening up. So it's a moot point.
</p>

<p>
	When you try to make awakening mainstream, it turns into crap like Catholicism or Mormonism.

<p>
	But the danger is you will become a sheep who walks off a cliff along with the herd.

<p>
	This work is full of dangers. Which is why so few people truly master it.
</p>

<p>
	You can go deeply by yourself. You don't need to crawl up someone's ass to go deep. RationalWiki doesn't need to blindly follow me. All they need to do is sit down and do the practices by themselves. It would also be a mistake for RationalWiki to only listen to my teachings. They should cross-reference my teachings with those of a 100 other gurus, yogis, mystics, philosophers, psychonauts, etc. to find the common ground.
</p>

<p>
	Working through this material carefully by yourself is the key. Nothing can be taken for granted, believed, or assumed.

<p>
	It's important to distinguish between have an orgie with sexual assaulting people.
</p>

<p>
	If women freely elect to sleep with Bentinho, that's their business.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the trick is that his presence draws them in and charms them. So it's easy for him to build a harem if he wants.

	The mind and body are full of various impurities which must be burned out before one is able to settle comfortably and joyfully in the Void.
</p>

<p>
	Much of this "pain" is fear, trauma, and mental resistance of various sorts.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I have no serious criticisms of him. He knows his shit.
</p>

<p>
	He doesn't deny love. He talks quite a bit about Eros (his term of Love), and he says that the driving force behind all evolution is love. Which is correct in my view, although even that doesn't go far enough to underscore the importance of Love in all of Creation.
</p>

<p>
	He might not be as explicit about Infinite Love as I am, equating Love & Truth. But that's probably because he has not accessed some of the deepest insights I have accessed via psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	I think his understanding of reality would be deeper if he went deeply into psychedelics. But oh well. It's good enough. You can only ask so much of a guy. He has done several life-times-worth of amazing work.
</p>

<p>
	Ken is one of the greatest Western philosophers and intellectuals who has ever lived. We are lucky to be alive alongside him. It's sad that his health as deteriorated so quickly.
</p>

Really, the question becomes so internalized that it melt away and all you're left with is the raw present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry must take you out of your mind. If you're doing it as the level of mind, that's not going to do much. Out of your mind is the key. You must leave behind the verbal / logical domain.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics work by effortlessly taking you out of your mind.

<title>Spending $3000 on a Pick-Up Boot Camp - Good Idea?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/42510-spending-3000-on-a-pick-up-boot-camp-good-idea/?do=findComment&amp;comment=531556</link>

<p>
	A) You can certainly find cheaper trainings.
</p>

<p>
	B) You'd get a lot more value out of simply connecting with a few experienced wingmen in your city who can show you the ropes for free.
</p>

<p>
	Bootcamps can be a good way to get yourself in the game but the chief problem is that they are too short. Your results will not come from the bootcamp but from the daily follow-up work you do. The follow-up work is the most important part. Because every weekend needs to become your personal bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the importance of having just 1 or 2 experienced wingmen to go out with every weekend. This is HUGE! It's worth much more than a bootcamp in terms of results.
</p>

<p>
	But if you got the money to burn, a bootcamp can be a good way to jumpstart this whole process.
</p>

<p>
	I did a bootcamp for $2000, but I got a lot more value from finding great wingmen. I also had lots of money to burn, so $2000 was not a big deal to spend.
</p>

<p>
	You can find wingmen via online forums or by attending an RSD FreeTour in your city. Befriend everyone at the FreeTour. Get their phone numbers and start going out with them every night.
</p>

<p>
	All that a bootcamp really is, is some dude telling you to approach girls and forcing you to do it all night long. If you can discipline yourself to approach all night long, you don't really need a bootcamp. But of course this discipline is really hard for newbies, so you may need it.
</p>

<p>
	If we were doing a bootcamp, we would just walk into a club and I would point out random girls and force you to approach them. After you fail, I would just tell you to immediately approach the next girl. We would do this 20-50 times over 3-4 hours.
</p>

<title>Would an Enlightened Person be able to say no to heroin?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Keep in mind that the the Absolute is distinct from the structures of the mind/brain/self. Which means it's possible to awaken but still have addictions. Because addictions are baked into the structure of the mind/brain/self. Awakening itself does not necessarily change the mind/self. Which is why an awakened person can still smoke cigs, have a porn addiction, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of it this way: awakening disidentifies you from your mind. But the mind still continues to fire according to its lifetime of karma. If you spent a lifetime watching porn, your mind has been programmed with that habit, and awakening will not automatically remove all that. You will have to retrain your mind.
</p>

<p>
	This is why many awakened people are still flawed and still have bad habits and cravings.
</p>

<p>
	The mistaken assumption is that awakening will perfect the mind. This is simply untrue in practice. What perfects the mind is deliberate training, which many people neglect to do, especially after an awakening or two.
</p>

<p>
	Perfecting the mind is harder than awakening.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you could get many awakened people hooked on heroin. Because in truth they ain't that awake.
</p>

<p>
	YES! This is exactly what awakening is about.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not something you think. It's more felt. It's pure, raw experience. Ideally the mind is shut off or at least sidelined.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is nothing other than the present moment, observed intensely for what it is.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like this Kratom helped you enter a mild samadhi state. It's not an out of body experience, it's a nondual state of consciousness. Which is exactly what you want in this work. From this state you can now contemplate metaphysical questions and get profound answers -- not verbal answers but actual answers!

<p>
	That was your answer to the question: Who am I?
</p>

<p>
	There is much deeper to go. You are only seeing the tip of the Ox's tail. So keep exploring.

<p>
	This is such a fluke condition that you cannot apply it other mental disorders.
</p>

<p>
	Mental disorders are legion, and most of them will slow down your path to awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are also some "disorders" which are called disorders but really are not. Don't forget that "disorder" is relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	Many a foolish doctor would call enlightenment a "disorder", without realizing that being a doctor is the real disorder here.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it funny how considering oneself to be a human is not considered a disorder? Talk about self-bias! Lol

	Be careful about getting too emotionally invested in Leo the persona. It isn't real. It has no import.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking highly of me will only become an obstacle in your work.

<p>
	If you're having dreams about me, you're attaching too much importance to me.

<title>Criticism of Ken Wilber</title>

<p>
	Having read the criticisms in more depth, I want to underscore that many criticisms of Ken Wilber are foolish and that the bulk of his written work is as solid as can be.
</p>

<p>
	Minor criticisms like his support for Andrew Cohen, Adi Da, and his over-emphasis of the Mean Green Meme and his political prescriptions are all knit-picks compared to the bulk of his written work, which is solid, and which has little to do with those things.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get distracted by the politics surrounding the Integral Institute. Just focus on his written work, which is genius.
</p>

<p>
	And as always, don't expect any teacher to be perfect in their embodiment or conduct.
</p>

<p>
	The criticism's of Ken Wilber found on the following website, for example, are pure BS:

<title>Suicide for a good cause - Ego or Selflessness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/42539-suicide-for-a-good-cause-ego-or-selflessness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=531487</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	It can be an act of selflessness. Think of Christ or Gandhi. You can basically sacrifice yourself for your life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	But this is still all part of the relative domain of life/death. From the Absolute perspective there is no one to die.
</p>

<p>
	But if you get it in your mind this idea of "I will sacrifice myself in the name of glory and I will go down in history as a good human being." << That's ego
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to create a self-righteous fantasy about sacrificing yourself. Rather, act as though you are not important at all.
</p>

<p>
	There is no sense is committing suicide for a good cause. No good cause requires your suicide. Rather just do your work and if you happen to get killed in the process by some haters, so be it. But if you actively try to be a martyr, that's ego.
</p>

<p>
	A true martyr never tries to be martyr. He's just doing his work and others react to it.
</p>

<p>
	If your life becomes selfless and has great impact on others, you will naturally develop haters who wish you harm.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of the notion of a soul is that it persists between lifetimes as an intermediate structure between the human self and the Godhead.

<p>
	If soul is just ego, the notion of soul isn't needed at all. The point is in its being prior to ego.

<p>
	Like I said, these are nuanced distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course from the ultimate absolute level nothing can be distinct at all, at which point soul merges into the godhead.

<p>
	Of course you cannot ever be totally independent of your sources and influences, but that is not really a problem.
</p>

<p>
	All that's important is that you don't follow others too closely and diversify your sources.
</p>

<p>
	Keep a healthy distance from your teachers/gurus. Learn from them but follow your own path.
</p>

<p>
	Don't go crawling up your teacher's butthole. Don't go live with them. Don't go work for them. Don't go sleep with them.
</p>

<p>
	This is just such obvious stuff. Yet people blindly do it and then act shocked when they get hurt.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you let your guru stick his dick inside you, you will regret it. That was your fault really for letting things get that far.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to maintain healthy boundaries.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on how you look at it.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest level of consciousness a soul is none other than God. So in this sense there is no soul. All souls are just partitions in the mind of God and made of nothing.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			If everybody is God, then how can God, that is perfect, be submissive to illusion? If the soul equals to God, then how can the individual Soul find itself subject to the limiting effects of illusion? Doesn't that lead to the conclusion that illusion is superior to God because it has the power to put God under illusion?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer to this set of questions must of course be riddled with paradox since we are now talking about the Absolute using dualiatic language.
</p>

<p>
	If God is unlimited, it must be unlimited in its ability to limit itself, otherwise it would not be unlimited. If God could not constrain itself inside an illusion if its own making, that would be a limit, which contradicts its unlimitedness. This God is so all-powerful it can fool itself. Illusion is not superior to God because God wills the illusion into existence, and also because there is no difference between illusion and reality, superior and inferior. All of these differences only exist in the mind of God and nowhere else.
</p>

<p>
	God IS the power of infinite illusion. Illuison IS creation! Illusion IS God's greatest power.
</p>

<p>
	If you just imagine an infinite mind, you can easily see that this mind can easily imagine being a finite thing, like a table or a kangaroo or a human. Just as you as a human adult can imagine yourself to be a child. It's easy to imagine something less than you, hard to imagine something greater than you. It's hard for a donkey to imagine God, but easy for God to imagine a donkey.

<p>
	My point is precisely: No!
</p>

<p>
	Blindly following even the best human being of all time will result in evil.
</p>

<p>
	Goodness is not a function of content, but structure. Conformity is the structure of evil.
</p>

<p>
	Blind following is what created mankind's greatest evils. The core problem is blindness. If you are blind, you will commit evil. Nothing can compensate for being blind. And no one can make you see but yourself.

<p>
	Seems like fair criticism.
</p>

<p>
	What must be remembered is that self-bias, survival, self-deception, partialness, and incompleteness are unescapable aspects of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to follow Ken Wilber blindly rather than thinking independently for yourself is the crucial mistake. Trying to join and follow groups too closely is the key mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Why on Earth would anyone want to join some "integral institute" and follow the work of one man blindly?
</p>

<p>
	Everything must be thought through for yourself.

<p>
	The brain itself is a trap within consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful with this idea that "the brain" anchors reality. This is the crucial knot that must be cut. Throw your brain out the window.

	Imagine death? Lol. Death has always been imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Without imagination there cannot be a notion of death.
</p>

<p>
	If you're thinking "death", that's you imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Even the notion of suicide is imaginary, since you must imagine yourself not existing. Which is an impossibility.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well imagine that you are a horse.

<p>
	That's going to become a trap.
</p>

<p>
	To awaken you're going to have to face the truth that all meaning is imaginary. This will feel depressing and nihilistic to the ego. Awakening only comes AFTER you let go of all desire for meaning. The ego is a meaning-constructing machine. It will not want to surrender all meaning. It will backlash hard against it. It needs meaning to survive. But so long as you are stuck in survival mode you are not truly awake.
</p>

<p>
	So your desire for an antidote is the very thing which will keep you from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to awaken you must bite the bullet and face the meaninglessness head-on, without any cushion or comfort. This may result in a Dark Night of the Soul as the ego dies a slow painful death, facing the fact that everything you believed in and hoped for was a lie.
</p>

<p>
	Only AFTER ALL THAT, awakening dawns and what seems like nihilism become DIVINITY.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is DIVINITY. But divinity requires a total loss of meaning. You cannot reach divinity by clinging to antidotes.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to let go of meaning. Take a leap of faith into emptiness. Drown in a lake of meaninglessness and see what lies on the bottom.
</p>

	Again, all that is your own projection.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind serves up whatever you want to see/hear. So it's no surprise you get all your ideas validated.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that all the US intelligence agencies agree that Russian was involved in the 2016 election and is still continuing it's manipulation. Roger Stone, Trump's contact with WikiLeaks was just sent to prison for lying to congress about his connections. Trump himself asked on live TV for Russia to hack and release Hillary's emails. Case closed.
</p>

<p>
	You think by having an edgy non-mainstream opinions that you're somehow being smart, but you're just being foolish. Just because your opinion differs from the mainstream doesn't make it true. When you challenge the mainstream you have to be grounded in something solid, not just being edgy. The US intelligence agencies are a lot smarter than you.

<p>
	Science cannot ever tell you what anything is. Because science is relative. All it's doing is telling you relative differences between things, never what the thing actually is.
</p>

<p>
	For example, science cannot tell you want a cat is, it can only tell you how a cat is different from a non-cat.

<p>
	The more conscious one becomes, the more one's life becomes about spreading love to others.

<p>
	At the highest level, God creates selflessly for the benefit of all living beings, needing nothing for itself. There is no greater joy or purpose than this. Nothing else is worthwhile for an advanced intellect.

<p>
	You aren't talking with enough girls, that's the only reason.
</p>

<p>
	Talk to more girls and you'll get a GF. Stop making this some deep metaphysical ordeal.
</p>

<p>
	You should get rejected by 5 girls per night. Then success will come quickly. You are getting rejected too little.

<p>
	Is there really a romance, or is it all in your mind?
</p>

<p>
	Just because you see it as a romance does not mean she does.
</p>

<p>
	There is a tendency for desperate guys to see a romance where none exists from the girl's POV.

</p>

<p>
	That is the most powerful technology. Nothing else comes close.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that any technology which truly worked at radically altering your consciousness would be made illegal because it would destabilize the mind and undermine the illusion of society and its power structures.
</p>

<p>
	If a technology can make you awaken, it can also make you lose your mind.

<p>
	Of course, after the successful manipulation in 2016, now every foreign government will try the same. It's open season. Our inaction and denial only invites further manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	It's clear to everyone now that if Trump is helped by foreign manipulation, Trump himself will welcome it and protect the manipulators because all he cares about is winning at any cost. This is the essence of treason.
</p>

<p>
	Russia has a special position though because of Trump's finacial ties with Russian oligarchs. They underwrote his loans and enabled his whole fake career. China is not as well situated. And Russians have worldclass hackers with zero ethical standards.

<p>
	Of course
</p>

<p>
	But there is still also attachment to subtle form in the occult arts.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate is total God-realization. That's what you really want, more than occult games.
</p>

<p>
	You won't regret becoming God.

<p>
	Of course, because there is nothing but states of consciousness. Whatever state of consciousness you find yourself in, it completely sets the parameters of what you can access and do.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why someone in the wromg state of consciousness will never awaken or understand.
</p>

<p>
	Also, awakening cannot be stored in memory because memory cannot be formlessness.

<p>
	I have no problem with exchange of money because teachers gotta eat. It takes a lot of time and work to coach people 1 on 1.
</p>

<p>
	Even if it was free, giving people false promises about instant enlightenment is problematic because if it doesn't work it sours the student's path. It makes students believe awakening must be easy so they stop working for it.
</p>

<p>
	The proper attitude to cultivate in students is one of hard work and disciplined practice. And if it happens easily and quickly for you, that will be a nice surprise. But don't count on it.

<p>
	This is a classic bullshit marketing tactic and it should not be accepted because it gives spirituality a bad name. Someone will go to Fred, fail to instantly awaken, and then start to believe that it's all BS or that something is wrong with her, when in fact this is the normal result.

</p>

<p>
	Awakening literally requires nothing. Anything you add takes away from it.
</p>

<p>
	All you must do to awaken is sit totally still and be fully present of the NOW for very long periods of uninterrupted time. Your mind must go as quiet as possible. Just total stillness and focus.
</p>

<p>
	You might be able to use hypnosis to quiet the mind and focus it on the present moment. But then just sit there and be present. It takes a lot of presence. So much presence you start to hallucinate a bit and your visual field goes wavey.
</p>

<p>
	Mental activity and lack of focus is the number obstacle to awakening. Anything you do to try to hasten the process is mental activity, which slows down the process. So it's about learning how to get out of your own way.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic.
</p>

	Don't fooled by his marketing. Nothing instant about it. He loves to bullshit about how fast it is. Yet he doesn't mention all the cases in which it fails to work. And he cherrypicks clients who already have years and decades of experience.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely misleading and irresponsible.

<p>
	It all depends on the scope of your vision and time frame.

<p>
	In the short-term there will be lots of suffering due to climate change. But in the long-term I'm not too worried about it. Mankind will adapt and grow.
</p>

<p>
	Most people don't think more than 50 years ahead and they have no deep understanding of the evolutionary potential of mankind. They tend to assume mankind is a static thing that will just do the same stuff as now. No! Mankind will massively evolve in consciousness, technology, and society in the next 100-500 years. Mankind will become unrecognizable, we will evolve so much.

	Again, I have to caution you guys, you're getting yourself into an epistemic quagmire by taking these linear scales too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	There are far more dimensions to consciousness work than any linear scale can capture. You're gonna mislead yourselves.

<p>
	The Buddha spent 7 years as a hardcore ascetic and yoga practitioner. He mastered many yogic techniques of concentration and samadhi states in those 7 years, outdoing all of his teachers and masters. That's 7 years of full time work. And still he was not liberated. So THEN he did those 49 days of nonstop sitting under the tree to get the final blow.
</p>

<p>
	People love to leave out the hard work and crazy discipline that goes into such things, creating fairy-tales of "instant enlightenment". No such thing. There's nothing instant about it.
</p>

<p>
	And all of this still fails to account for his extraordinary talent, wisdom, and motivation from a young age. He wasn't just some random guy off the street.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody on this forum has the capacity to even do those 49 days of non-stop sitting. Think about it.

<p>
	Haha, it sure seems that way from your POV. But in fact necessity dictates Infinite Love.

</p>

<p>
	As things get worse mankind will be forced to wake up and rise to the occassion. Our biggest problem lately is that life has gotten so easy people are getting complacent. A climate crisis will force people to get seriously engaged rather than taking things for granted.

I think his embodiment of Green is fine.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously he is very cognitively inclined, but I wouldn't fault him for that, that's just his personality/style. Being perfectly well-rounded is not the goal.
</p>

<p>
	I would just say that his understanding of American politics is somewhat naive and impractical. There is a big difference between Sprial development and making good practical political plans.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't automatically assume Ken has the right political plans to move the country forward, even though he is clearly an amazingly well-developed human being.
</p>

<p>
	Good political leadership is its own thing. I would trust Bernie more on this front.

<p>
	This is explained in the video: What Is Love? - Part 2
</p>

<p>
	Can you see that for a Hitler to exist, God would have to be unconditionally loving to allow that?
</p>

<p>
	If you had a son and he wanted to become Hitler, it would take infinite love for you to allow him to follow through on that and still love him despite all the suffering and hurt you know he will cause. AND STILL you love him afterwards! That's true love. Giving someone the freedom to be whoever they want to be -- even if they want to be a mass murderer -- is true love.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Love = Infinite Freedom
</p>

<p>
	A selfish person cannot allow true freedom because he's too scared that its consequences might kill him.
</p>

<p>
	If God prevented the possibility of Hitler, God would become a selfish devil, which God cannot ever do because God has infinite consciousness and would never allow for anything less than Infinite Love to exist. So Infinite Love cannot exist if Hitler cannot exist.
</p>

<p>
	This is all very counter-intuitive to a selfish person. Luckily God has no self, so it has no problem executing it.
</p>

	Sometimes, if you get too attached to mechanical meditation, you might need to back off and just chill. But telling most people to chill is wrong advice. Most people are too chill and lazy to begin with. They need more discipline.
</p>

<p>
	The average person is too undisciplined and too untrained, not overly-disciplined and over-trained. So my advice would always err on the side of discipline and training. Only for very advanced students would I suggest easing up on the training.

<p>
	I was making important clarifications, not for my sake but to clear up confusion in the minds of readers.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes people misunderstand why I do or say certain things.
</p>

<p>
	Criticize away. It is good to have feedback. I'm always looking for quality feedback, and checking for blind-spots.
</p>

<p>
	See, again, this is an important clarification to make because people get the wrong idea that I'm not open to feedback or that I'm set in my ways. To hold such a view is a misunderstanding of my work. I want you guys to drill it into your minds that you should always be checking yourself for blind spots, as I do. You need the capacity to receive feedback and check your own positions.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes people get the wrong idea that I'm an absolutist simply because I speak with confidence about having become conscious of the Absolute. But I'm not an absolutist at all. It's tricky to teach these epistemic principles because people simply don't do any epistemic inquiry, so everything just devolves into beliefs and positions for them.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really care about being wrong because being wrong is how I grow.
</p>

<title>Ken Wilber Inteview On Jordan Peterson</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/18096-nickyy/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="18096" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/18096-nickyy/" rel="">@Nickyy</a> Ken Wilber himself is pretty harsh on Green. He's written entire books about it.
</p>

<p>
	I think Ken has an overly negative view of Green because he grew up in an era were Green was on the rise and that left a sour taste in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
	Ken is obviously way above Green, but I think he underestimates how much of America and the world still hasn't tapped into Green almost at all. Ken seems too eager to skip over Green and get to Yellow. But 80% of the population is still confused and in denial about Green, never mind Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Ken was deeply involved in academia, where Green is very over-represented. This is JP's problem too. Because they live in an academic bubble they tend to see the excesses of Green on college campuses without realizing that college campuses are not at all an accurate representation of the general population.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to focus on college campus culture because it gives them an easy target to attack without addressing the real elephant in the room: much of the country is still stuck in Red, Blue, and Orange. << that is the real problem.
</p>

<p>
	Trumpism is the result of lack of Green development in the general population. Trumpism discredits Ken's and JP's ranting against Green. Trumpism could not occur without a big collective Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Green has its excesses but they pale in comparison to the excesses of Red, Blue, and Orange which we are seeing in real time with Trumpism and other nationalist movements around the globe. That is a true danger to democracy, not feminist college kids fighting to save the whales.
</p>

<p>
	Ken's and JP's views of Green are way out of proportion and get the political priorities backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Ken criticizes Green from above, JP criticizes Green from below.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, exactly. So if you miss that crucial period, you'll never be able to compete with someone who trained.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's my point.
</p>

<p>
	But the added wrinkle is this: people who train 10,000 hours are not normal people, they must already have a rare capacity and desire to do that. Having the right desire is 80% of the key to success.

			Are you saying if people on here dont do 10 000 hours they wont have at least an awakening? This work is hard but its not that impossible lol.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I'm saying people are all different. Some people will awaken after 10 hours of work, others will not awaken even with 10,000 hours. It depends on all the factors I mentioned above.

			You seem to be projecting the blue/conservative view of "if you work hard, you will get rewarded for it" onto spirituality. This idea that work pays off linearly and simplistically.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, that's not what I said at all. Go back and re-read all my posts in this thread. I am saying that awakening is not linear or simplistic. It depends on many factors, many of which are not in your direct control.
</p>

<p>
	But since the only thing you can really control is how much time and effort you put it, in practice, that is the most important factor. You can't change your genetics, past lives, early childhood, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There is also a huge difference between merely awakening vs mastery. Any fool can awaken through some luck. Mastery is never accidental and requires thousands of hours of practice. Mastery is 100x rarer than awakening. Talent is important but not sufficient for mastery. For mastery to happen, everything has to align AND you have to work your ass off for years. Which is why it's so rare.
