<title>Denver Decriminalizes Mushrooms</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/8/18535475/denver-psilocybin-psychedelic-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization-vote" target="_blank">Denver Successfully Decriminalizes Mushrooms</a></p>
<p>Horray! A small step for mankind.</p>
<p>This is exciting and groundbreaking news, as in the history books it will go down as the first domino to fall in our effort towards full nationwide decriminalization of psychedelics.</p>
<p>In truth, decriminalization of psychedelics is still not good enough. The US Constitution must have an Amendment which explicitly guarantees the right to explores one's own consciousness via any means that does not harm others.</p>
<p>This is of course on top of the already existing Constitutional clauses which guarantee free exercise of religion, which of course includes psychedelics (but is not yet acknowledged).</p>
<p>But we'll take this for now.</p>
<p>Oregon and California are working to pass legalization of mushrooms in 2020. A victory in Oregon would be a huge breakthrough, and it now seems doable.</p>
<p>Please donate to the <a href="https://psi-2020.org/" target="_blank">Oregon 2020 Psilocybin Ballot Initiative</a> to ensure it passes. If it does, that will be huge leap forward. It will also help many people suffering from depression, addiction, PTSD, anxiety, terminal illnesses, etc. Check out their video page for more details.</p>
<p>And here's another good initiative you can donate to if you're passionate about this cause: <a href="https://heffter.org/" target="_blank">The Heffter Research Institute</a></p>

<title>Elite Universities Are A Scam</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/elite-universities-are-a-scam</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Most people in society are in denial about the scam that is elite university education (and to some extent, university education in general).</p>
<p>Read this article: <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/1/18311548/college-admissions-secrets-myths" target="_blank">Former Admissions Dean Spills The Dirt On Elite College Admissions</a></p>
<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the kind of devilry that goes on behind the scenes of these elite universities. Do not trust them for a second!</p>
<p>Universities are not your friend. They are businesses, collective egos, bureaucracies, and cultural constructions, first and foremost. It is a big mistake to equate university education, rank, or credentials with any sign of truth, goodness, wisdom, intelligence, consciousness, self-awareness, or level of development.</p>
<p>The wisest humans are not to be found in universities because universities do not prioritize truth, wisdom, love, or consciousness. Elite universities are playing games of status, money, and politics, and the worst thing about it is, the biggest con they pull is convincing high school students that they are somehow important and to be valued. It's never even told to high school students that they can provide themselves with a much better education than any university ever could, and at a tiny fraction of the cost. High school students just automatically buy into the lie that elite universities are somehow important and desirable.</p>
<p>Universities indoctrinate. They do not teach truly original thinking or human growth. And as the devil tends to do, they call themselves the bastions of truth. Then they act outraged if you question their authority or their well-credentialed professors. Ha! What a load of horse shit! A credential is just a piece of paper that a group of devils wrote to themselves to convince themselves that they are not devils but angels.</p>
<p>The whole point of getting an elite university degree is so that your survival in life becomes much easier thanks to the status it confers — you get access to the best job opportunities and positions of power — so you don't then actually have to work hard on becoming a conscious human being or doing original creative high-value work that stands on its own merit. An elite university allows you to use the power of social status to increase your survival odds. That's what it's really about, and any honest university would admit it. But of course the devil has to hide and deny his devilry in order for it to keep working. Teens who apply to these universities do not understand any of this. They are just cogs in the unconscious machine. Just like their parents were. They are under the illusion that these universities are somehow the ticket to heaven when really they're a ticket to hell! You know what they say, an abused child becomes an abusive parent. And so the cycle continues, the cogs keep spinning around in circles.</p>
<p>And all this is not to even mention the scam which is the college loan system. From a certain perspective a modern university is just a clever invention for saddling a new human being with $100,000 in debt without that human realizing what just happened. That is the lifeblood of the whole system! Universities are like a vampire that feeds off wage slaves. The real devilry comes in convincing children to join this system eagerly. You could call our entire education system long-time-horizon child abuse: grades, homework, standardized testing, SAT prep, AP testing, college admissions, student loans, credentials, diplomas, fraternities, sororities, college athletics — all that. It's all a socially constructed scam; a house of cards held together with bullshit. By the time a human being goes through 12 + 4 years of that, she is a domesticated animal. It's just a more sophisticated version of religion. A religion masquerading as science and rationality. No wonder there is no God or Truth found there. You cannot institutionalize Truth.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, an elite university education will actually hinder your ability to become the best human being you could be. Take responsibility for your own education. The only one who can properly educate you is yourself.</p>
<p>And yet, despite having said all the above, a university education is still far better than no education at all, or some kind of parochial education. So in a twisted sense we need this devil to save us from the yet greater devil of uneducatedness and right-wing ideology.</p>
<p>P.S. Do not confuse my critique of universities for right-wing critiques of universities. Universities can be critiqued from above or from below. My critique is from above. Right-wing critiques — based on a knee-jerk reaction against liberal values, multi-culturalism, relativism, and post-modernism — are from below. The paradox is that American society would be far better off if we made all public universities totally free to everyone, doubled their annual budgets, and cancelled all student debt. This would also have the benefit of devaluing elite private universities and reduce the need to jump through hoops for scholarships.</p>
<p>Our education system is thoroughly corrupt and badly in need of reform and massive funding. Of course it's just as you should expect. The first thing on the devil's agenda is to seize and corrupt all wellsprings of truth, turning them into founts of devilry. Topmost on the devil's agenda is to break all the lights, break all the mirrors, and multiply himself in the shade.</p>

<title>Ayn Rand's Stage Orange Witchdoctory</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/ayn-rands-stage-orange-witchdoctory</link>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>"While scientists were performing astounding feats of disciplined reason [during the Enlightenment], breaking down the barriers of the 'unknowable' in every field of knowledge, charting the course of light rays in space or the course of blood in the capillaries of man’s body — what philosophy was offering them, as interpretation of and guidance for their achievements was the plain Witchdoctory of Hegel, who proclaimed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">matter does not exist at all</span>, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything is Idea</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not somebody’s idea, just <i>Idea</i></span>), and that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this Idea operates by the dialectical process</span> of a new '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">super-logic</span>' which proves that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contradictions are the law of reality</span>, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A is non-A</span>, and that omniscience about the physical universe (including electricity, gravitation, the solar system, etc.) is to be derived, not from the observation of facts, but from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contemplation of that Idea</span>’s triple somersaults inside his, Hegel’s, mind. This was offered as a philosophy of reason."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand" target="_blank">Ayn Rand</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And she was precisely wrong!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It takes skill and effort to be this wrong. The skill of a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/what-is-the-devil" target="_blank">devil</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Stage Orange</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism" target="_blank">materialism</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism" target="_blank">rationalism</a> underestimates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism" target="_blank">idealism</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism" target="_blank">mysticism</a> by assuming it to be philosophical mental-masturbation with no real-world consequences, when of course the truth is that materialism/rationalism is itself thoroughly deluded because it fails to take into account higher states of consciousness, which, if achieved, will erase the illusion of a material or rational world altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here Ayn Rand demonstrates the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5Qn6K36Ug" target="_blank">pre/trans fallacy</a>: confusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" target="_blank">Hegel</a>'s trans-rational explanations of the Absolute with pre-rational myth, fundamentalist religion, and soft thinking. In truth, Ayn Rand's dualistic logic was closer to myth than Hegel's.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The great irony is that materialism and rationalism turn out to be Witchdoctory — the very thing they accused philosophy and religion of being! Such is the counter-intuitive nature of the mind. To a devil like Ayn Rand, black is white, up is down, light is dark, and Absolute Truth is fiction. I've noticed that people who make vehement appeal to "reason" (like Ayn Rand or Sam Harris) turn out to be some of the greatest devils because they assume that reason is somehow a guarantor of truth, when in fact reason does the bidding of the ego. You cannot get to Absolute Truth through reason. Which totally shocks stage Orange rationalists, because they always held in blind faith that you could. A rationalist is just someone who replaces fundamentalist religious faith in the inerrancy of The Bible or Koran with a fundamentalist faith in the inerrancy of reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hegel was a spiritual genius. He was the Western/German version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna" target="_blank">Nagarjuna</a> or The Buddha. But his words fell on deaf ears and got confined to history books or philosophy lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Interestingly, when you start to research Western intellectual tradition you find a strong thread of idealism running all throughout which few Westerners today know about or take seriously. This gives a false impression that the West has always been materialist and anti-mystical, and that science has always been a materialist enterprise. Not true. This is an artificial narrative constructed by materialists to relieve themselves of the responsibility of taking idealist notions seriously. Many of the West's greatest scientists, thinkers, and visionaires were idealists, and for good reason. Because the more intelligent you become, the more idealism becomes unavoidable. Realist scientists and thinkers are 2nd rate intellects. They are good at technical analysis but they lack the holistic visionary aspect of the intellect, which is the most important aspect.</p>
<p>The intellect has two functions: analysis and synthesis, or division and unification. The intellect can be used to carve up reality or stitch it together. Modern academic and Western intellectual culture is overly biased towards analysis at the expense of synthesis, vision-logic, unification, and big picture thinking. Our schools teach kids how to carve up reality but not how to stitch it together. As a result our science and our society is overly-autistic and disconnected from our humanity and our divinity. Modern science lacks heart and vision. Which doesn't mean that science is bad or all-wrong, it just means that modern science is highly partial, and that there is a higher version of science yet to be actualized. Science and reason are not to be abandoned but expanded.</p>

<title>Spiral Dynamics Case Study</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/spiral-dynamics-case-study</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a beautiful video demonstrating the difference in worldview and reality of stage <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Blue</a> vs <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Orange</a>/<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">Green</a>.</p>
<p>Here's Orange/Green reacting against stage Blue.</p>
<p>Notice that Orange/Green simply cannot understand the stage Blue worldview because it's biased by an unquestioned certainty in the materialist paradigm. What stage Orange/Green does not understand is that there is no such thing as objective reality, "facts", "truth", or "sanity".</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruh0RqzHmC0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Stage Blue vs Orange/Green are literally inhabiting different realities which their minds are constructing. But since they do not understand that their mind constructs reality, they assume that their reality is the one "true" reality while the other side is literally insane. This notion of insanity plays a pivotal function in their worldview because they need some way of explaining away the otherwise without actually investigating it. By calling the other side "insane" it automatically absolves you from having to seriously question your notion of "real".</p>
<p>What needs to be realized is that however you think reality is, you're making that up! "No Leo, I'm not making it up. You're crazy!" << You just made that up! Lol. See? Your metaphysical assumptions become your reality, no matter how crazy, unreasonable, or false they are. So if you believe there is an objective external reality, that becomes your reality. But it is not true in any absolute sense. Your mind is making reality up as you go along. Including, of course, the denial that you do so.</p>
<p>There actually is no firm boundary between a crazy worldview and a reasonable one. That duality collapses upon deep examination.</p>
<p>Without deeply understanding this you will never understand what reality is, how it works, or why humans behave as they do. For you there will always be stuff that happens in the world which seems totally batshit crazy. But it only appears that way from your POV because your worldview is inadequate at accounting for other worldviews. As a rule of thumb, any time you see something crazy happening in the world, that's a clue that you don't understand it deeply enough. The mind uses the judgment "that's crazy" as a cop-out.</p>
<p>With all that said, some people are exceptionally deluded.</p>

<title>Fat Leo</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/fat-leo</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Folks have been asking me to release a photo of when I used to be fat. Some even accused me of making up the story that I used to be fat. Well, I was in fact fat from about age 9 to age 21.</p>
<p>I didn't have fat photos of myself because: 1) Back then there were no cell phones or selfie pics, 2) I didn't like taking photos of myself when I was fat.</p>
<p>But anyhow, I finally found an old photo at my Mom's house. So here you go:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4203" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/leo-pic-01.png" alt="leo-pic-01" width="604" height="842" /></p>
<p>235 lbs at 6'2". 20 years old. About one year after this photo was taken I lost 65 pounds in 5 months, dropping to 170 lbs. I've kept it off ever since. Right now I'm at 180 lbs.</p>
<p>This was accomplished through diet changes & lots of gym exercise, including cardio and weights. I worked out 5 days a week for about 10 years. For the past 2 years I have not worked out at all and still keep the weight off because my diet is about 10x cleaner than it used to be, such that exercise for purposes of weight-maintenance is unnecessary. But exercise is still good for health of course.</p>
<p>Big change is possible if you set your mind on it. The most important aspects of accomplishing a change like this are: 1) vision, 2) discipline, and 3) focus.</p>
<p>Because my videos are so abstract and metaphysical sometimes people overlook the meat of this work. Personal development is very practical stuff with very tangible results. Don't let the abstract explanations fool you. You must also be results-oriented. Get shit done by whatever means necessary. Claw your way up <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/using-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-to-self-actualize" target="_blank">Maslow's Hierarchy</a>. If you're new to personal development you need to dial in the basics like health, diet, career, finances, living environment, family situation, dating, etc. Don't get so metaphysical that you neglect all that. You will find awakening impossible if you can't even stop eating junk food or can't earn enough to pay your rent.</p>

<title>So Are You Chinese Or Japanese?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/so-are-you-chinese-or-japanese</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a perfect little example of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/understanding-duality-part-1" target="_blank">dualistic thinking</a>:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_CaZ4EAexQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This kind of thinking is extremely common at <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics Stage Blue</a>. But watch out! — dualistic thinking is still present in spades at higher stages. It's not just rednecks who think in this black-and-white way. You do it every day! Don't fool yourself into thinking you're above dualistic thinking. Dualistic thinking can be very subtle and it affects even the most rational and scientific thinkers. Rationality and science are chock full of dualities.</p>
<p>There's more to reality than the simplistic categories your mind creates.</p>

<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/james-cameron-on-ecological-awareness</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really intelligent and self-aware perspective on ecology & environment. It's a stage Yellow perspective. Notice the nuance and complexity of it. It balances science, business, art, and compassion, transcending AND including stages Orange and Green. Notice the lack of blaming problems on someone else. Notice the attitude of meeting people where they're at. Notice how science & spirituality/religion are not pitted against each other. It's a cooperation of left and right brain, mind & heart. Notice the systems thinking.</p>

<title>Quintessence: The 5th Element</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/quintessence-the-5th-element</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Classically, the 4 elements were Air, Water, Fire, and Earth. The 5th element — which few people know about — was called the quintessence (literally, "the 5th essence") or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)" target="_blank">Aether</a> — otherwise known as Nothingness or Emptiness or Void.</p>
<p>In science, Aether was known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether" target="_blank">luminiferous ether</a>, the medium through which light and gravity waves were supposed to have propagated. In the early 20th century physicists like Einstein and others "debunked" the notion of ether by reasoning that light waves did not need a medium to propagate through. They ran various experiments trying to measure the existence of ether but nothing turned up, so they discarded the notion as superfluous. Except Aether is not superfluous, it is central! What the scientists did not understand, and still do not understand, is that Aether wasn't a measurable medium like water, air, or even space — it is Nothing! This is not the same as saying that Aether does not exist. Aether exists as Nothing, the Groundless Ground, or pure Existence itself — existence devoid of any content. Don't bother trying to measure it because you can't. Existence is prior to measurement. The medium for the propagation of light waves and gravity waves (and anything else for that matter) is consciousness. And also don't confuse Aether/Nothingness with the vacuum of space. Aether is prior to space or time. It "holds" space and time.</p>
<p>What people don't understand is that quintessence is not just Nothingness, it is not just Existence, it is also Consciousness, Truth, God, Love, Goodness, Intelligence, Self, Other, and World!</p>
<p>But how can Love be Nothingness? How could it not! Only Nothingness has the capacity to embrace all. Only Nothingness is selfless enough to embrace all. Only no-thing can unconditionally accept every-thing. The embrace is so complete that Nothingness literally IS everything! This is pure, Platonic Love. Not just love as an emotion (although it is that too), but love as Being itself. Love is the union of all opposites into one seamless totality. Love is the unification of all divisions. Love is the super-set of all sub-sets. Love is universality. Love is infinity. Love is unlimited.</p>
<p>The 5th Element got their metaphysics exactly right:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6a0Q0rfbUVI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>After all is said and done, in the final analysis, the force that saves the world is none other than the force that makes the world: Love.</p>
<p>You ARE quintessence. You ARE Love.</p>
<p>Your ability to unify all opposites, all dualities, is the measure of your love. It is Unity as an Absolute. A Unity so all-embracing it has no opposite. A nonduality so nondual it doesn't know duality. A Love so complete it does not know judgment, criticism, rejection, hatred, selfishness, or evil. Yet at the same time it embraces them all by being them all. Human love is a tiny branch off the tree of universal Love. This tree is infinite, with countless branches of varying size. You are one branch AND you are the entire tree. To actualize one branch is to be human. To actualize the entire tree is to be God. Each branch is not other than the tree, such that all there is, is tree. What it means to be a tree is to be each branch and the sum total of them all at once. To realize this totality is Truth and Love.</p>
<p>Notice, when you feel an emotion of deep love, what you're feeling is not an egoic desire but a selflessness and a deep unity with the universe. In that moment you are being selfless, and it feels right and good. It feels divine.</p>
<p>So how do you conquer evil? By experiencing yourself as Love. Just like in the clip above. It sounds childish, until you try to do it and you quickly see just how hard it is for your ego to do. It is the mark of a masterful sage to be able to embrace all. You can't do it because you have too much evil in you. All-encompassing Love threatens you like light threatens a shadow. You can't do it because you are too busy defending your self while Love is self-less-ness. Love is also fearlessness. If there is no self, there is nothing to lose, and nothing to fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"A coward is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave."</p>
</blockquote>

<title>&quot;I Cannot Self-Terminate&quot;</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/i-cannot-self-terminate</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Terminator 2 is — in my opinion — one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid the final scene always moved me:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEMICfWLOig?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>It's such a brilliant final scene, filled with spiritual significance.</p>
<p>Now I understand why I liked it so much. It represents the hardest things for an ego to do: self-terminate. It represents the stark brutality of total selflessness.</p>
<p>How do you ask a self to self-terminate?</p>
<p>You see? That is why this work is hard.</p>
<p>"Be melting snow. Wash yourself of yourself." — Rumi</p>
<p>WARNING: Do not confuse self-termination with suicide. I am talking about spiritual self-termination. Suicide is just more ego.</p>

<title>The Joy Of Creation</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-joy-of-creation</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It took some gamer-nerd 300 hours to build this epic roller coaster. When I saw it, it reminded me of God's infinite creative potential — of how life and reality just goes on and on and on like an endless roller coaster.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/afhBFffMvZU?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>You might wonder, "So what? Why would someone waste 300 hours creating this silly thing? What the point?" The point is CREATION itself! God likes to create amazing stuff just for the hell of it. When you have infinite creative capacity, when you have unlimited intelligence, when you have unlimited power, when you have an eternity — what else are you gonna do? You have somewhere you gotta be?</p>
<p>CREATION is its own end. As you go chasing awakening and Nothingness, do not overlook CREATION! It's everywhere and everything! You might look at this roller coaster and see some gamer-nerd making something pointless. But that's not some nerd, that's God! That is the unlimited creative force of the whole universe materializing itself into a roller coaster! God is the sum total of all chains of creation, of which this roller coaster is one chain. That force is designing everything from atoms to cells to animals to galaxies and beyond. Can you see it? It is unlimited creation. It cannot stop. It bursts infinitely with new creative forms and ideas, ultimately spawning everything that can ever be.</p>
<p>If life feels depressing and bleak, it's because you're failing to step into your role as Creator. Creation is a spiritual activity. Every time that gamer-nerd works on perfecting his roller coaster, he's in church. And when you look upon and delight in his creation, recognizing the God in it, you are in church. What if your work and your church were one and the same? Wouldn't that be a life worth living?</p>
<p>Never forget, you are a creator. You are THE creator. What are you gonna create with your life?</p>
<p>I hope it's something at least as cool as this rollercoaster.</p>
<p>P.S. Notice what the guy in the video says at the very end of the ride, at timestamp 10:02. He says, "OH. MY. GOD!" That's right. That's exactly right.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca3eYxZedD4" target="_blank">epic Aliens rollercoaster</a>.</p>

<title>Solo Retreat Notes</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/solo-retreat-notes-feb-2019</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I ended up taking 23 pages of notes during my solo retreat.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>And I'm back!</p>
<p>It's been a crazy 29 days of consciousness work, featuring 13 profound awakening experiences — each one deeper than the last. Impossible levels of consciousness were accessed that few human beings have ever experienced.</p>
<p>I'll tell you all about it after I collect my thoughts. There is a lot to say, yet at the same time, it is impossible to put it faithfully into words.</p>
<p>I have a truckload of the deepest insights to share.</p>

<title>Bernie 2020!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/bernie-2020</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Today Bernie Sanders announced his entry in the 2020 Presidential race and I am thrilled to endorse him. I don't typically endorse politicians, but he is by far the best politician in the country today. He is a serious visionary leader and his policy platform is outstanding. If you want to live in a more conscious, less plutocratic America, please <a href="https://berniesanders.com" target="_blank">donate</a> & support Bernie because the establishment ego backlash against him will be yuge!</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgJagAiHimk?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Sanders' 2020 policy platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicare 4 All</li>
<li>Green New Deal/climate</li>
<li>$15 min wage</li>
<li>Criminal justice reform</li>
<li>Free college</li>
<li>Break up biggest banks</li>
<li>Campaign finance reform</li>
<li>Gender pay equity</li>
<li>Paid leave</li>
<li>Lower drug prices</li>
<li>Expand Social Security</li>
<li>Save unions</li>
<li>DREAM Act</li>
<li>Background checks & assault weapons ban</li>
<li>Affordable housing</li>
<li>New infrastructure</li>
<li>Opposing military industrial complex</li>
<li>Legalization of weed</li>
<li>Abolish private prisons</li>
<li>End cash bail</li>
<li>Major police department reform</li>
</ul>
<p>Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is. If you are short on cash, consider volunteering for <a href="https://act.berniesanders.com/signup/volunteer" target="_blank">his campaign</a>, the <a href="https://www.justicedemocrats.com" target="_blank">Justice Democrats</a>, or <a href="https://www.wolf-pac.com" target="_blank">Wolf-PAC</a> to get corporate money out of government.</p>

<title>Textbook Example Of Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/textbook-example-of-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't particularly like to kick a man when he's down, but the following video shows the unraveling of Alex Jones' ego in such a stark way that it deserves to be in a textbook about devilry. Pay close attention to how the arrogance of the ego-mind refuses to concede to truth and love, doubling down on its egotism and starting a holy war (lesser Jihad). This is how crusades and holy wars throughout history have been started.</p>
<p>Alex Jones is just an extremely obvious example of this. But notice how your ego does this too, in (hopefully) lesser, more subtle ways. It especially happens when you feel under attack or when your livelihood or identity is seriously threatened.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL1ShzYHvD8?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As context for this clip, on his podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B93fUUiuwMs" target="_blank">Joe Rogan extended a hand of friendship to Alex Jones</a>, genuinely concerned for his mental health. Joe took a fair, compassionate position, being more than generous to Alex Jones, but the devil cannot stand it! The devil is terrified of genuine love and compassion — he thinks it's a ploy. Love burns the devil like a sunlight burns a vampire. Rogan is speaking from a healthy stage Green while Jones is speaking from a very pathological stage Red. Stage Green often underestimates the depravity and viciousness stage Red is capable of — it is outside of stage Green's reality.</p>
<p>The fundamental position of the devil in aggressive defiance of God. At low levels of Spiral Development the ego becomes aggressively ignorant and, of course, assumes the position of God. The devil always feels like he is the righteous one who could do no wrong and that God is on his side. The devil is a usurper of God's throne, actively spinning delusions and self-deceptions to convince himself that what he's doing is righteous.</p>
<p>Remember this: a devil will not hesitate to bite a helping hand. So be careful when openly offering them your compassion.</p>
<p>P.S. Please don't misunderstand me when I call Alex Jones a devil. Despite how it sounds, I am not actually demonizing him. When I call someone "a devil" I do not use this term dualistically or moralistically. I am not making a moral judgment of him. For me this is a technical term describing delusional egoic behavior which aims at supplanting truth with its own selfishness. Like how a cuckoo bird tries to lay its own egg in the nest of other birds.</p>

<title>Entrainment Demo</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/entrainment-demo</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Check out this cool video demonstrating entrainment:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aaxw4zbULMs?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice at the end how they all de-sync without the soda cans.</p>
<p>Consider that the soda cans are culture. Culture allows human beings to entrain with each other. Which is why people defend their cultures to the death.</p>
<p>P.S. Your brain gets entrained to certain types of sounds and music just like the pendulums above. Various spiritual techniques make use of such brain entrainment — like binaural beats, Solfeggio frequencies, chanting, mantra recitation, and shamanic drumming — in order to access higher states of consciousness. Is this New Age voodoo? No! Does it really work? Yes! Give it a try, if you dare. There is a spooky yet legit connection between your state of consciousness and auditory vibrations.</p>

<title>Profound Quotes #014</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/profound-quotes-014</link>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Abandon the search for God and the Creation and other matters of a similar sort. Look for him by taking yourself as the starting point. Learn who it is within you who makes everything his own and says, 'My God, my mind, my thought, my soul, my body.' Learn the sources of sorrow, joy, love, hate. Learn how it happens that one watches without willing, rests without willing, becomes angry without willing, loves without willing. If you carefully investigate these matters you will find him in yourself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">— Monoimus, quoted by Hippolytus of Rome</p>

<title>Neoclassical Economics Is A Cult</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/neoclassical-economics-is-a-cult</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Free-market capitalism (especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics" target="_blank">Chicago School</a>) is a dangerous cult ideology. Similar to positivism, behaviorism, and materialism. A lot of otherwise intelligent people get sucked into them because the group-think and status quo is so strong it goes completely unquestioned, masquerading as "science" or "fact". The devil loves to lie using mathematics because it gives him the perfect cover of "objectivity".</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JeplRmADW3E?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course Marxism also tends to be cult-like. But right now America has a serious addiction to capitalism, to the point of being in denial about it.</p>

<title>A Strange Loop Universe</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/a-strange-loop-universe</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Consider the following intriguing possibility:</p>
<p>According to modern cosmology, our universe started as an infinite singularity which spontaneously blew up and started expanding at an accelerating rate, which it is still doing today. There has been some speculation that in the future it might start to decelerate and eventually crash in on itself in a Big Crunch, back to where it began. An elegant solution, but our universe currently shows no sign of deceleration so I wouldn't hold my breath. So let's assume it just keeps accelerating outwardly forever. What then? How do we end it in an elegant way?</p>
<p>Thermodynamics tells us that ultimately the universe will end in entropic heat death, where all the atoms dissipate their kinetic energy until the entire universe is one energetically uniform, lukewarm field. This is the universe's most boring state. Nothing interesting to see or do because everything is so uniform that everywhere is the same. There's nowhere to go and you don't have enough of an energy gradient to power anything (no cars, no power plants, no life). Everything is one uniform temperature and eventually even all the atoms decompose into a perfectly uniform soup.</p>
<p>But at precisely this point our perfectly uniform universe also becomes indistinguishable from a singularity! Now, you might think, "But wait a minute, this new singularity is a billion times larger than the old one, due to billions of years of expansion." Except size, distance, and time are all relative notions. In a totally uniform universe it is impossible to distinguish distance or time and hence impossible to distinguish the old singularity from the new singularity, making them literally identical!</p>
<p>After all, who is to say there is difference between beginning and end?</p>
<p>And suddenly the whole thing explodes again.</p>
<p>Ta-da! We've come full-circle!</p>
<p>But wait, it gets even stranger! If reality is nothing but distinction, could it be possible to eliminate the distinction between something and nothing, reality and unreality? After all, who is to say that the universe is real or has ever even happened?!</p>
<p>This very moment you are sitting here reading this sentence thinking you are inside an actual universe which has happened. But perhaps if you realized that "actual" is a distinction that you are creating, you could also collapse it, thus making it literally impossible to distinguish an "actual" universe from its opposite, a "potential" universe, thus nullifying this very moment, as though it never actually happened, all at the same time as it appears to be happening!</p>
<p>After all, who is to say there is a difference between happening and non-happening?</p>
<p>So, was there an actual Big Bang or not? Adapting, a bit, the famous words of Henry Ford, "Whether you think there was, or think there wasn't, you're right!"</p>
<p>How does God create something out of nothing? By imagining a difference between the two.</p>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
<p>So while everyone else is running around taking life seriously, you might be able to realize that life isn't happening at all. Perhaps existence is only possible as an idea.</p>
<p>Sounds insane? Who is to say there is a difference between sane and insane? ;)</p>
<p>Here's an interesting video long these lines, although not quite as radical. Modern cosmology is still not addressing the elephant in the room: the relativity of existence itself.</p>

<title>Capitalist Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/capitalist-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I love Anand's analysis of the current state of American society. Everything he's talking about is the limits of Spiral Dynamics <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">stage Orange</a> which I have explained in my video.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fdt5a6CJ3HY?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_zt3kGW1NM?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the kind of political analysis I'm into. Notice how different it is from the commonplace partisan bickering, namecalling, and conventional thinking.</p>
<p>Notice also how the themes he talks about are part of the much broader dynamic of devilry (see video <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/what-is-the-devil" target="_blank">What Is The Devil?</a>). Devilry is nothing other than the force of blind self-survival. This force is so strong because it needed to be that strong in order to get you to where you are right now. But then survival goes overboard, becoming counter-productive. As is always the case with duality, too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- Upton Sinclair</p>
<p>Of course rich people are not going to understand how they create global suffering and inequality because it is against their self-interest to understand. That would be too much consciousness, too much responsibility. Then they could not pursue wealth as ruthlessly as they do. The devil is always going to resist seeing that he is the devil. This is true not just of rich people, but EVERYONE! Religious people, military people, Big Oil, Big Pharma, criminals, children — and YOU! I want you to notice that you are not conscious of the collateral damage that your own survival produces because it doesn't help your survival to be conscious of it. So you are in deep denial about it. Notice the stories and justifications you create for how you are not a devil but an angel. It is precisely these stories which make you a devil! Ta-da! Self-deception at its finest.</p>
<p>What's that you say? "But Leo! I need money, I need sex, I need medicine, I need a house, I need a good school for my kids, I need X, I need Y, I need Z. If I stop pursuing my survival needs, I will die!"</p>
<p>Exactly! Exactly...</p>

<p>While we're on the topic of politics, here are my favorite political channels on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSeder/videos" target="_blank">The Majority Report</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9oQdIk1MfcnzypG3UnURA/videos" target="_blank">The Rational National</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SecularTalk/videos" target="_blank">Secular Talk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MidweekPolitics/videos" target="_blank">The David Pakman Show</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoungTurks/videos" target="_blank">TYT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MikeAnthonyTV/videos" target="_blank">The Humanist Report</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/democracynow/videos" target="_blank">Democracy Now!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that I do not necessarily agree with all of the ideas & opinions these channels espouse. These are <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">stage Green</a> channels. They are definitely biased and ideological. My view of politics is at least <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-yellow" target="_blank">stage Yellow</a>, so I have some important criticisms of these Green channels, but in an environment where stage Yellow political analysis is virtually non-existent, this is as good as you're likely to find, for now. We have a lot of growing to do just to get society to Green, nevermind Yellow. There will definitely be some excessive and unhealthy manifestations of Green from time to time, but right now I'm not too concerned about it.</p>
<p>Rather than adopting my personal political beliefs, what I suggest you do with this domain of life is to study it (if you want). Become serious about understanding how government & society works in a systemic, non-partisan, non-culture-war way. Set aside your political prejudices and educate yourself. Be careful not to get radicalized and not to build a political ego. Be careful about confirmation bias. Diversify your news sources and seriously investigate the positions of your political opponents. But also don't fall into the trap of false equivalency, splitting issues evenly down the middle, or automatically accepting the status quo. By not making a choice, you've made a choice in favor of the status quo. By not taking action, you've taken action in defense of the status quo.</p>
<p>When it comes to politics, you're damned if you do, but you're even more damned if you don't.</p>
<p>If you are seriously working on enlightenment you might want to stay away from politics for a while so it doesn't turn into a distraction. But overall, you should be well-informed about various political trends and what makes for good governance. You might want to subscribe to a serious journalistic new outlet like the New York Times or Washington Post and actually read their articles. Also, read books on politics and governance. You cannot understand this domain of life without some in-depth reading and a sense of history.</p>
<p>Above all, remember, proper politics and governance is not about what YOU need. It's about what helps elevate the majority of mankind. Often times what's good for the greater system may not be what's personally good for you, your family, your ethnicity, your gender, or your company. Be very careful not to make politics just another survival game that your ego plays.</p>

<title>The Cult Of Capitalism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-cult-of-capitalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Excellent analysis of the current state of America:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-2TEwdRnX0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice how Spiral Dynamics explains all this, and foreshadows the next inevitable development step. We are beginning to reach the limits of unbridled stage Orange.</p>
<p>Be careful not to turn the current state of society into a victim mindset or an excuse for why you can't create a great life. Never let aggregate macro trends dictate your personal effort and results. It doesn't really matter what others are failing to do, what matters is that you do what you need to do. Conscious capitalism is possible, and you can lead the way in that.</p>

<title>Inside The Alex Jones Cult</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/inside-the-alex-jones-cult</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's an outstanding interview by David Pakman with the wife of Alex Jones, offering a rare glimpse into the self-delusion and narcissism fueling the Alex Jone phenomenon.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebByb9JJgJg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is very typical of unhealthy Spiral Dynamics stage Red. Alex Jones is basically an online cult leader.</p>
<p>Watch out! The 21st century will see many more cults forming online. The online medium is ripe for exploitation and weaponization by devils proclaiming themselves to be angels. YouTube, Facebook, Google, Twitter, iTunes, Instagram, etc will all be hijacked by devils to some degree, in the same way that TV, radio, and newspapers were. The devil always thrives in newly developing media because they lack legal regulations and ethical norms. The devil thrives in the wild west, which is one of the fundamental flaws of anarchism and libertarianism. In a wild west environment the biggest devils will rule.</p>

<title>Inside The R. Kelly Sex Cult</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/inside-the-r-kelly-sex-cult</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I hope you get from watching my videos is just how timely, relevant, and practical all of the stuff we talk about is. Philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, psychology, and spirituality are not just some wooly academic pursuit, their effects are felt throughout culture every day. You can see it in the news every day if you know what to look for because the principles we discuss on Actualized.org are so fundamental they shape all human action across all geographical locations across all time.</p>
<p>Here's but one example:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2muGNE9t_s?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>This is a good example of a secular cult.</p>
<p>R. Kelly seems to exhibit quite a bit of unhealthy Spiral Dynamics stage Red, which is quite common for rappers and cult leaders.</p>

<title>Aztec Nonduality</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/aztec-nonduality</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Should it be any surprise at this point that the Aztecs were nondualists?</p>
<p>Here's a summary of Aztec metaphysics from the <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/" target="_blank">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"At the heart of Nahua (Meso-American) philosophy stands the thesis that there exists a single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power, energy or force: what the Nahuas called teotl (God)<em>. </em>Elizabeth Boone writes, 'The real meaning of teotl is spirit — a concentration of power as a sacred and impersonal force'. According to Jorge Klor de Alva, 'Teotl implies something more than the idea of the divine manifested in the form of a god or gods; instead it signifies the sacred in more general terms'. The multiplicity of gods in official, state sanctioned Aztec religion does not gainsay this claim, for this multiplicity was merely the sacred, merely teotl, 'separated, as it were by the prism of human sight, into its many attributes'.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teotl continually generates and regenerates as well as permeates, encompasses, and shapes the cosmos as part of its endless process of self-generation and regeneration. That which humans commonly understand as nature — e.g. heavens, earth, rain, humans, trees, rocks, animals, etc. — is generated by teotl, from teotl as one aspect, facet, or moment of its endless process of self-generation-and-regeneration. Yet teotl is more than the unified totality of things; <strong>teotl is identical with everything and everything is identical with teotl</strong>. Since identical with teotl, the cosmos and its contents ultimately transcend such dichotomies as personal vs. impersonal, animate vs. inanimate, etc. As the single, all-encompassing life force of the universe, teotl vivifies the cosmos and its contents. Lastly, <strong>teotl is both metaphysically immanent and transcendent</strong>. It is immanent in that it penetrates deeply into every detail of the universe and exists within the myriad of created things; it is transcendent in that it is not exhausted by any single, existing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nahua metaphysics is processive. Process, movement, becoming and transmutation are essential attributes of teotl. Teotl is properly understood as ever-flowing and ever-changing energy-in-motion — not as a discrete, static entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although essentially processive and devoid of any permanent order, the ceaseless becoming of the cosmos is nevertheless characterized by an overarching balance, rhythm, and regularity: one provided by and constituted by teotl... Dialectical polar monism holds that: (1) the cosmos and its contents are substantively and formally identical with teotl; and (2) teotl presents itself primarily as the ceaseless, cyclical oscillation of polar yet complementary opposites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teotl's process presents itself in multiple aspects, preeminent among which is duality. This duality takes the form of the endless opposition of contrary yet mutually interdependent and mutually complementary polarities that divide, alternately dominate, and explain the diversity, movement, and momentary arrangement of the universe. These include: being and not-being, order and disorder, life and death, light and darkness, masculine and feminine, dry and wet, hot and cold, and active and passive. Life and death, for example, are mutually arising, interdependent, and complementary aspects of one and the same process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The created cosmos consists of the unending, cyclical tug-of-war or dialectical oscillation of these polarities — all of which are the manifold manifestations of teotl. Because of this, <strong>the created cosmos is characterized as unstable, transitory, and devoid of any lasting being, order or structure</strong>. Yet teotl is nevertheless characterized by enduring pattern or regularity. How is this so? Teotl is the dynamic, sacred energy shaping as well as constituting these endless oscillations; it is the immanent balance of the endless, dialectical alternation of the created universe's interdependent polarities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because essentially processive and dynamic, teotl is properly characterized neither by being nor not-being but by becoming. Being and not-being are simply two dialectically interrelated presentations or facets of teotl, and as such inapplicable to teotl itself. Similarly, teotl is properly understood as neither ordered (law-governed) nor disordered (anarchic) but as unordered. Indeed, this point is fully general: life/death, active/passive, male/female, etc. are strictly speaking not predicable of teotl. Teotl captures a tertium quid transcending these dichotomies by being simultaneously neither-alive-nor-dead-yet-both-alive-and-dead, simultaneously neither-orderly-nor-disorderly-yet-both-orderly-and-disorderly, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, teotl is essentially an unstructured and unordered, seamless totality. Differentiation, regularity, order, etc. are simultaneously fictions of human unknowing and artistic-shamanic presentations of teotl. In Western philosophical terminology, one perhaps best characterizes the radical ontological indeterminacy of Nahua metaphysics as an extreme nominalist anti-realism, and teotl, as a Kantian-like noumenon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nahuas philosophers also conceived teotl pantheistically: (a) everything that exists constitutes an all-inclusive and interrelated unity; (b) this unity is sacred; (c) everything that exists is substantively identical and hence one with the sacred; (d) the sacred is teotl. <strong>There is only one thing, teotl, and all other forms or aspects of reality and existence are identical with teotl</strong>; (e) teotl is not a minded being or person.</p>
<p>Teotl is a sacred artist who endlessly fashions and refashions itself into and as the cosmos. The cosmos is teotl's grand, ongoing artistic-cum-metaphorical self-presentation; teotl's ongoing work of performance art or 'metaphor in motion'.</p>
<p>Teotl artistically-cum-shamanically presents and masks itself to humans in a variety of ways: (1) the apparent thingness of existents, i.e. the appearance of static entities such as humans, mountains, trees, insects, etc. <strong>This is illusory, since one and all are merely facets of teotl's sacred motion;</strong> (2) the apparent multiplicity of existents, i.e. the appearance of discrete, independently existing entities such as individual humans, plants, mountains, etc. <strong>This is illusory since there is only one thing: teotl;</strong> and (3) the apparent exclusivity, independence, and irreconcilable oppositionality of dualities such as order and disorder, life and death, etc. <strong>This is illusory since they are interrelated, complementary facets of teotl.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an epistemological consequence of teotl's self-disguising, when humans customarily gaze upon the world, what they see is teotl as a human, as a tree, as female, etc. — i.e. teotl self-disguised — rather than teotl as teotl. <strong>Wisdom enables humans to discern the sacred presence of teotl in its myriad disguises.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is humans' misperceiving and misunderstanding teotl as its disguise which prevents them from seeing teotl (reality) as it really is. The only way humans experience teotl knowingly is to experience teotl sans description (non-symbolically). Humans experience teotl knowingly via a process of mystical-style union between their hearts and teotl that enables them to experience teotl directly i.e. without mediation by language, concepts, or categories. One comes to know teotl through teotl."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words:</p>

<p>You are Teotl!</p>
<p>This is one of the most beautiful & complete articulations of nonduality that I've ever come across.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you become so conscious of the truth of a matter that you just go silent.</p>
<p>Truth and silence work both ways: deep truth results in long silence, long silence results in deep truth.</p>
<p>Train yourself to bask in silence, like a cat basking in the rays of the sun.</p>

<title>Philosopher's Lamp</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/philosophers-lamp</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I love this example of a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">strange loop</a> by Belgian surrealist artist, Rene Magritte.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4088" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/rene-magritte-philosophers-lamp.jpg" alt="rene-magritte-philosophers-lamp" width="615" /></p>
<p>Here's how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> describes Magritte's style: "He became well known for creating a number of witty and thought-provoking images. Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context, his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality. Magritte's constant play with reality and illusion has been attributed to the early death of his mother."</p>
<p>René Magritte described his paintings as "visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable."</p>
<p>Just like nonduality. God is a strange loop. You try to know yourself, but you cannot.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>People sometimes think, "But Leo, how am I going to make a career out of my passion? What if my passion is something weird that cannot earn money?"</p>
<p>What people don't understand is, virtually any passion can be turned into a profitable life purpose and a career. Especially now in a globalized internet economy. Look at how this guy is following his passion:</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.consciouscapitalism.org" target="_blank">Conscious Capitalism, Inc</a> is a non-profit organization started by the founder of Whole Foods, John Mackey, whose mission is to integrate consciousness with business. They take a Spiral Dynamics stage Green/Yellow approach to business.</p>
<p>Pretty cool!</p>
<p>If you are running a stage Orange business and you do not evolve your business into Green or above in the next 50 years, your business will be crushed by Green/Yellow corporations. So stop chasing max profits and start thinking strategically about how your business fits within human society at large. Your business must serve a super-ordinate purpose beyond lining your wallet.</p>

<title>Monism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/monism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4069" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/monism_01.png" alt="monism_01" width="292" height="292" /></p>
<p>Monism is simply the idea that "strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing, the Universe, which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things" and that "only one kind of stuff exists, although many things may be made up of this stuff."</p>
<p>This "stuff" is consciousness, or "mind", out of which EVERYTHING is made. So... An atom is consciousness; a tree is consciousness; a car is consciousness; a rock is consciousness; the sun is consciousness; a mathematics equation is consciousness; a political party is consciousness; the Big Bang is consciousness; your skull is consciousness; the pixels on this screen are consciousness; and so on until every last object in the universe is accounted for. Reality is one unified field of consciousness which subdivides itself in infinite variations.</p>
<p>This is a very elegant and powerful explanation of reality. It also happens to be Absolutely True. It is so true that its truth is prior to any religion, philosophical system, scientific theory, or physical law. It is more true than 1 = 1.</p>
<p>I recommend you thoroughly read this Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism" target="_blank">Monism</a>. It's a great encapsulation of metaphysics, religion, and God across history. Monism is just another word for nonduality, and every culture around the world has a storied history of it because it turns out to be the ultimate truth. The only problem is that ultimate truth turns out to be a tricky thing for the mind to grasp, leading to much confusion and controversy.</p>

<p>These are the kind of games I was interested in making when I was a game designer. It took me several decades to realize that my love of game design was really just my interest in showing off the beauty of God. That's really what all art is about.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't realize how deep our motivations run until we're years into our spiritual journey. Most artists do not understand why they are artists. It's a form of pseudo-spirituality.</p>
<p>This game goes well with my other video: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/life-is-a-maze" target="_blank">Life Is A Maze</a></p>

Winning or losing is all one organic mechanism, from which one extracts what one needs."</p>

<p>At the very end of the video, notice Mumon's instruction in response to the monk's attempt to answer his koan. The monk's answer came from the ego-mind, not the enlightened mind. Hence he failed the koan.</p>

<title>How To Plug Psychedelics</title>

<p>Very important: Make sure you empty your bowels right before doing this, otherwise the substance will fail to properly absorb and your trip will be very weak. Treat this as an unbreakable rule: must go to the toilet before plugging.</p>
<p>Also, always trip on an empty stomach. Especially with 5-MeO-DMT, you want a TOTALLY empty stomach for at least 4 hours prior to the trip. This will make the difference between a great trip and a horrific trip. Do not violate this rule unless you like to suffer.</p>

<title>Understanding Fascism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/understanding-fascism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Fascism has recently been on the rise in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Here's a really good interview. I also highly recommend you read the author's book.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViPtWRJKu-Q?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The only thing missing from this discussion is an understanding of Spiral Dynamics.</p>
<p>Notice how both the interviewer and the author still don't have a deep grasp of where fascism sits along the spectrum of human development and what lies beyond stage Green progressive politics (of which TYT is a solid example).</p>
<p>Imagine how much better TYT would be if they understood Spiral Dynamics! Their analysis would be on another level entirely.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a life purpose and biz opportunity, start a news network like TYT but which covers politics from a stage Yellow integral perspective. That is the wave of the future. We have a severe lack of stage Yellow news networks and political commentary.</p>

<title>Whirling Your Way To Enlightenment</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/whirling-your-way-to-enlightenment</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>There are more techniques to get enlightened than most people imagine. Case in point: Turkey's traditional Whirling Dervishes. Many Western tourists know of this odd-looking ritual, but how many of them know that this is a legit enlightenment technique? Developed by none other than the great Persian mystic Rumi.</p>
<p>Whirling is not just a hokey ritual but a form of active meditation. The spinning is designed to shut off the egoic monkey mind and produce states of ecstatic trance.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi_whirling" target="_blank">Sufi Whirling Dervishes on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The symbolism of the ritual is pretty interesting too. The dancer wears a tall thick camel hair hat which represents the tombstone of the ego. The dancer's white skirt represents the shroud of the ego which must be cast off (sound familiar?). The taking off of the black cloak prior to whirling represents spiritual rebirth into the Truth. The crossing of the arms represents the number one, for the nondual unity of God. The whirling is done around the center of the heart, which represents unconditional love for reality. And mantras are mentally recited while whirling to further still the monkey mind.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHjFgOfoZ7M?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>If you decide to give whirling a try at home, watch out that you don't hit anything, or fall down, or faint from dizziness. This can be a physically dangerous technique. You can easily crack your head open. Best to do it out on a grassy field.</p>

<title>Understanding Psychosis</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/understanding-psychosis</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really good video explaining how psychosis intersects with spirituality.</p>
<p>Very few Western scientists, academics, doctors, or mental health professionals understand what psychosis is and how to properly handle it — because they are spiritually ignorant, operating from the materialist paradigm. This is not a clinical problem so much as a cultural problem. Doctors will often just think of you as crazy and load you up on drugs, making the situation much worse. If you know anyone who has suffered from symptoms of psychosis, show them this video. It could be a life-changer.</p>

<p>If you're in the US, it's time to vote. Early voting has started in many states.</p>
<p>2018 is an important election cycle.</p>
<p>Who should you vote for? Vote for the most conscious, the most Spirally developed candidates who have a reasonable chance of winning. Do not fall into the trap of voting on single issues. Vote on the overall level of development of the candidate. The more conscious the leader, the better they will lead, the less corruption and egotism they will enable.</p>

<title>The Dunning-Kruger Effect</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a> explains why, when people are ignorant, they tend to be aggressively ignorant.</p>
<p>"If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is." — David Dunning</p>
<p>Basically, the more of a fool you are, the less capacity you have to recognize that you are being a fool. Have you noticed? — when dealing with a fool, how difficult it can be to convince him that he's a fool? That's precisely what makes him a fool!</p>
<p>Arrogance & intransigence are the hallmark of fools.</p>
<p>Humility is the hallmark of sages.</p>

<title>Hate or Love?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/hate-or-love</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really interesting look into a heavy version of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Blue</a> ethnocentrism.</p>
<p>Ethnocentrism means: "I love my family, people, my race, my religion, my country, my culture, my traditions We are the best!" The world is divided into us vs them. What happens to "them" — other peoples, races, nations, religions, countries, cultures — does not matter. They are basically dispensable. They can be hated, excluded, demonized, slandered, raped, killed, tortured, etc. That doesn't matter because "they" are not "us".</p>
<p>One of the astounding features of the ethnocentric mindset is that it lacks the self-awareness to realize that it is ethnocentric. It literally cannot see outside its own perspective. You must understand: just because you have the capacity to look at the world through different perspectives does not mean that everyone else does! Most people do not have this capacity! This capacity is not a given.</p>
<p>Very few people understand the ethnocentric mindset. Those who have developed beyond it cannot understand it because it looks like delusion of the highest order. To whose who are immersed in it, it looks totally natural, normal, and could not be otherwise. So neither side really understands.</p>
<p>I challenge you here not to judge, not to gawk, but to really seek to understand the mindset and worldview of an ethnocentric person. Get inside their mind. Look at the world as they see it.</p>
<p>Remember, about 70-80% of the world population is at ethnocentric stage Blue. It would be wise of you to develop a deep understanding of how they think.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFwOF9VTvhA?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Important Note: Ethnocentrism comes in many degrees. The example above is a fairly heavy degree. Not all stage Blue people are this heavy. Although, many of them are! — just in more socially acceptable ways.</p>

<title>Orange Fraud</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/orange-fraud</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>What many non-business people do not realize is just how much corruption, fraud, manipulation, and downright criminality is involved in forging success. Many successful <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Orange</a> people are really just fakes who strong-armed their way to the top through special privilege, backroom deals, and outright theft. Success is not an honest signal because it can be faked so easily. It's much easier to fake being a rich person than to fake being a loving person.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyYn1c5CVy4?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As far as Trump's fraud goes, this is still only the tip of the iceberg. It's a lot worse than anyone's yet disclosed. As predicted by Spiral Dynamics and ego dynamics.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not posting this as a political attack or some liberal talking point. I'm trying to unmask for you just how sneaky and fraudulent the ego is. Because a lot of naive people see a successful-looking ego and aren't able to realize that the success is just a front. It's not merely that Trump is fooling lots of people, first and foremost he is fooling himself. This is not a Trump issue, this is an ego issue. You can think of Trump as a zombified corpse possessed and reanimated by a spirit known as ego. This spirit dictates everything he does, making him very predictable.</p>
<p>It's important to realize that success is mostly a facade. Most celebrities you admire are paper thin. They are not well-developed, conscious human beings. This includes popular self-help authors, business leaders, PUAs, YouTubers, TV pundits, public intellectuals, etc. Even if you manage to become successful, you will still be rotten to the core and hollow inside. Never, ever, mistake success for development, consciousness, or happiness.</p>
<p>In our stage Orange society it can be challenging for people to distinguish between success and development — because most people have done zero deliberate development work. Which is how we ended up with Trump. As you become more developed and conscious of how the ego works, all of this will become totally transparent to you.</p>
<p>The entire stage Orange system of business is built on mass-scale white-collar fraud, exploitation, and manipulation. It's just carefully tucked behind a glamorous facade. This is not some kind of anomaly, this is business as usual. Totally normalized by stage Orange culture.</p>
<p>But you see, the problem with all the ego's lies and deceptions is that the truth always wins out in the end, leading to a tragic comeuppance. This is karma at its finest. Karma will be knocking on Trump's door for years to come.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? Repent devil! Bite the bullet now and align yourself with truth.</p>

<title>Psychedelic Receptors</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/psychedelic-receptors</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>There are dozens of different kinds of psychedelics and dozens of different kinds of neurotransmitter receptor sites in the brain. Each psychedelic has a unique neurotransmitter receptor site profile. This is like the psychedelic's unique fingerprint, which determines the qualitative effects you feel during the trip. It can be illuminating to compare the fingerprints for various psychedelics.</p>
<p>The following is a chart I put together that you won't see anywhere else. It maps over 40 receptor sites and a dozen psychedelic substances. Each vertical column represents the psychedelic's receptor fingerprint. Dark squares represent lowest activity, bright squares represent highest activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/psychedelics-receptor-chart-02.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3952" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/psychedelics-receptor-chart-02.png" alt="psychedelics-receptor-chart-02" width="615" /></a></p>
<p>Looking over this data, some interesting observations jump out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice the unique fingerprints of MDMA, ibogaine, and salvia. Salvia and ibogaine are two of the most unique substances. Ibogaine activates almost all the opposite receptor sites of conventional psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, and DMT. This should tell us that an ibogaine trip will be unlike any other (as people report). Salvia pretty much only activates one receptor site: KOR, which no other convention psychedelic activates at all. KOR alone is responsible for salvia's notorious craziness.</li>
<li>Notice how LSD is the most active overall psychedelic. It lights up so many receptors, and it certainly feels that way when you're tripping.</li>
<li>Comparing ordinary DMT with 5-MeO-DMT we can see that DMT is very active in the Alpha1A - Alpha2C range while 5-MeO is not. This suggests that the Alpha range is responsible for the intensive visual hallucinations that DMT is best known for, but which 5-MeO-DMT almost entirely lacks.</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the Imidazoline1 row. This receptor site seems to be responsible for the experience of infinite divine love. The 3 greatest activators of Imidazoline1 are: MDMA (219.7), DPT (340), and DIPT (356). But any psychedelic which is active in this row will have a good chance of giving an infinite love feeling during your trip. Interestingly, LSD has no Imidazoline1 activation.</li>
<li>Notice how unique and "mild" mescaline looks compared to 2C-B and 2C-E (its closest chemical cousins). Perhaps this is why people report that mescaline trips (despite the initial nausea) are some of the most pleasant trips, with few reports of bad trips.</li>
<li>Notice the differences and similarities between Psilocin & LSD.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chart would be even better if I could find some data for 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, AL-LAD, DXM, ketamine, bufotinine, and datura.</p>
<p>In the future, with more research, we should have really accurate maps like this for all psychedelic substances. We could even design new psychedelics to uniquely target specific receptor sites.</p>

<title>How Dogma Gets Made</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/how-dogma-gets-made</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a very important video. Watch it all the way through while doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be very mindful of your judgments.</li>
<li>Be very mindful of how you separate yourself from these Mormons in your mind, taking a "me rational", "them irrational" attitude.</li>
<li>Contemplate how your current place in life, and all of your beliefs, are the result of cultural indoctrination</li>
</ol>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ralXLnOqDI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Do not think you are any different than these Mormons. Fundamentally, every human in the world is just like them. All of your cultural, political, spiritual, rational, and scientific preferences were programmed into you in a very similar manner, just less obviously so. Think about all the ways you were indoctrinated: kindergarten, family, school, church, high school, university, friends, social circles, parties, sports, books, magazines, radio, TV, internet, video games, commercials, grocery stores, shopping malls, etc.</p>
<p>Contemplate the notion that ALL of your beliefs about reality are cultural programming. You didn't believe them because they were true, you believed them because you knew of no other possibility. Of course this includes all of your so-called "scientific" and "rational" ideas. Hardly a single idea you have came from independent contemplation of reality. And to top it all off, you basically run around infecting other people with your ideas just like the Mormon zombies above. And if anyone tries to point all this out to you, you will of course vehemently deny it.</p>
<p>Who would you be, what would your life be like today, if you had not been indoctrinated with all the ideas present in your head? Imagine if you were born into a Mormon family, a Muslim family, an orthodox Jewish family, a polygamous family, etc.</p>
<p>Watch out! You may think to yourself, "Phewwww! I'm so lucky I wasn't born into one of those fundamentalist families. I really dodged a bullet!" Except you haven't! All of your secular liberal ideals are also just cultural indoctrination. If you believe in the value of democracy, freedom, goodness, equality, justice, truth, etc. — all of that is cultural indoctrination! You did not invent a single one of those values/ideals. Notice this! Stop bullshitting yourself. Carefully trace where each of your ideals came from. Not the myth of where they come from, but where they ACTUALLY came from: someone indoctrinated you and you swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.</p>
<p>Only if you understand this will you have a chance of breaking free.</p>
<p>Try to imagine what it would take for those Mormons to break free.</p>
<p>Now you have a sense of what it will take you to escape The Matrix.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Eye-opening documentary about the intersection of ego, health, and environmental regulation.</p>

<p>Notice how the ego-mind rationalizes and adapts to unhealthy conditions as long as it serves the ego-mind's way of life. The ego-mind is not going to admit that its entire community and city are built on a toxic premise.</p>
<p>Notice how this is really an issue of collective ego.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Orange</a> and below turns a blind eye to these kinds of environmental concerns. This is all very predictable.</p>

<title>Politics &amp; Ego</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/politics-and-ego</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really good analysis by Fareed Zakaria of what's going on in global politics:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri9qP5YYEaM?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>He is talking about transitioning Europe and the US to <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Green</a>.</p>
<p>Politics is basically about evolving our identity as a nation. The turmoil we're seeing in politics today is the result of old, ethnocentric, nationalistic identities struggling to evolve into new, more global, more multicultural, more cosmopolitan identities. As the world gets smaller due to digital interconnection, ease of travel, migration, and inter-racial relationships the old national, cultural, and ethnic boundaries will inevitably get blurred, leaving many traditional egos feeling their identities threatened.</p>
<p>What is required is an openmindedness to a new, wider identity. You can no longer just be an American, a German, a Muslim, a Jew, a man — you must open yourself to being a global citizen, a human. It is not sustainable to maintain isolationism and nationalism in the face of a rapidly evolving global marketplace. The globe is only going to interconnect more, not less. Diversity will be thrust in your face whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>Zakaria cites political scientist Francis Fukuyama as saying, "Identity is the deep-seated psychological need to be recognized as possessing dignity." But this fails to appreciate the depth of the problem. Identity is not merely a psychological need, identity is an existential, metaphysical imperative. Threats to one's identity are not merely perceived as a psychological annoyance, but life-threatening. Because identity is not a physical, objective fact but a conceptual construction. One's identity and one's reality are deeply enmeshed and mutually reinforcing.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">stage Blue</a> and <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Orange</a> egos resist stage Green with such passion. To the ego this feels like battle to the death. Because it is death! Death = loss of identity. And the ego will always lose!</p>
<p>But it is also a rebirth into a larger, better, truer you. Your true identity is infinite.</p>
<p>The trick is to get over yourself. (Which of course no one wants to do.)</p>
<p>What people fail to understand about politics is that it's not merely a personal preference for various "good" or "bad" social and economic issues. No! Politics is a battle to invent "good" and "bad"! Politics is a battle to the death to define one's identity, reality, and to rig the structures of society to maximize the survival of one's ego. This is why you don't find much truth in politics. Its purpose is the opposite of truth: survival through fabrication.</p>
<p>Politically in the US and in Europe things are going to get worse before they get better. Stage Blue & Orange are entering their sunset phase in the highly developed Western countries, but they are not going away without a fight. Be prepared for backlash and desperate death throes over the next 50 years. Be prepared for lots of propaganda, fake news, demonization, and disinformation campaigns. This is how the devil plies his trade.</p>

<title>Salvia Trip Report</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/salvia-trip-report</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's an excellent salvia trip report. It gives a sense of how radically surreal consciousness can get. Salvia is one of the craziest psychedelics. I've heard descriptions like "I became a glass of orange juice" or "I drowned in a waterfall of Post-It notes."</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1Yux33LMPQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Saliva is a dangerous psychedelic which I do not recommend, and certainly never do it without a reliable trip sitter.</p>

<title>Silly Stage Blue Morality</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>This is how <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Blue</a> reasons about morality:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrcQ_PTkVD4?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>In reality, murder is NOT wrong precisely BECAUSE God exists! God IS murder! How could God be infinite and yet exclude murder?? In the eyes of God, nothing is wrong. Only in the eyes of a big fat ego — like Dennis Prager (above) — is anything "wrong".</p>
<p>This is the fundamental delusion of conservatives — they all tend to be moralists.</p>
<p>Oh, the ignorance!</p>

<title>What's Wrong With Jordan Peterson?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/whats-wrong-with-jordan-peterson</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>For those who ask, "But what's wrong with Jordan Peterson??" Here it is in 5 minutes directly from the horse's mouth, unedited:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LquIQisaZFU?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The fear-mongering and strawmanning here of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Green</a> is downright laughable. His argument may as well be a drawing of a hippie on a chalkboard with devil horns.</p>
<p>Peterson's is such an obvious stage <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Blue</a>/<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Orange</a> reactionary ideology.</p>
<p>What is this but a projection of Peterson's own fear of relativism, communalism, progressivism, and evolution?</p>
<p>"Damn you hippies! Damn you all to hell with your long hair, your drum circles, and your... your... equality, diversity, and inclusion! How dare you!", said the cranky old grandpa sitting on his porch.</p>
<p>Here's a hilarious blow-by-blow analysis, although it still misses the Spiral Dynamics perspective:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDNv0tQTw9k?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>P.S. PragerU is not a real university, it's a right-wing propaganda Youtube channel funded by stage Blue Christian fundamentalists and stage Orange hydraulic fracking billionaires as explained in this <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/inside-right-wing-youtube-turning-millennials-conservative-prageru-video-dennis-prager/" target="_blank">Mother Jones article</a>. They create videos like "Why Everyone Should Stand For The National Anthem" and "Just Say Merry Christmas". That Jordan Peterson would create content for such an organization tells you a lot about him.</p>

<title>An Atheist's Personal Experiences Of God</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/an-atheists-personal-experiences-of-god</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really good video of a guy who evolved from <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Blue</a> to <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">stage Orange</a>. Being now at Orange, notice how he falls into the Pre/Trans Fallacy, conflating orthodox religion with transpersonal, transrational consciousness. Notice how his understanding of mystical experience is warped by the stage Orange materialistic, rational, naturalistic paradigm. Notice how he uses the concept of "the brain" to metaphysically ground his entire understanding of reality, without realizing that the brain is also just a personal experience, a conceptual anchor point.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ro6VwyYO1A?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>You cannot deny the validity of mystical experience by saying "they are just experiences" because EVERYTHING, including the brain, science, reason, and proof, are also just experiences. However you ground yourself in "reality" it will always be through experience. (Until you realize the Groundless Ground.) It does not matter whether your experiences and justifications of those experiences are religious or scientific — they are equally mental constructions.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, when mystical experiences happen at the stage Blue level of development, the ego-mind interprets them in a limited, orthodox, ego-centric, chauvinistic way. To then re-interpret them via the scientific materialist paradigm is to evolve one stage, but it is to still fundamentally misunderstand what they are.</p>
<p>What's not being understood here is that the nature of reality is subjective and mind-constructed, and therefore "physical" reality can change if you just change the way you use your mind. This possibility is not taken seriously because Stage Blue and Orange underestimates reality. These stages assume that reality is a fixed, static thing, limited thing — which turns out to be a very mistaken metaphysical assumption.</p>
<p>Basically every atheist commits this mistake. They take it completely for granted that the metaphysics of modern science is correct and unquestionable. But it isn't! The atheist fails to understand that spirituality isn't about personal experience, it is about metaphysics.</p>
<p>These kinds of errors are the direct result of our culture's marginalization of metaphysics and epistemology. Because our culture de-emphasizes it, very few people investigate it or take it seriously, believing that "metaphysics has no practical applications". Well, here is your practical application! Lack of metaphysical depth leads to all sorts of fundamental errors in thinking — and what's worse, these errors go completely unnoticed. Because to notice them would require doing metaphysics, which nobody wants to do! Therein lies the tragedy of mankind in the 21st century.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The withdrawal of philosophy into a 'professional' shell of its own has had disastrous consequences. The younger generation of physicists, the Feynmans, the Schwingers, etc., may be very bright; they may be more intelligent than their predecessors, than Bohr, Einstein, Schrödinger, Boltzmann, Mach and so on. But they are uncivilized savages, they lack in philosophical depth."</p>

<title>Anekantavada</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/anekantavada</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you're a seeker of Truth, you need to understand the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada" target="_blank">Anekāntavāda</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Anekāntavāda ('many-sidedness') refers to the Jain doctrine about metaphysical truths that emerged in ancient India. It states that the ultimate truth and reality is complex and has multiple aspects. According to Jainism, no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the Absolute Truth. This knowledge... is comprehended only by the Arahats (enlightened masters). Other beings and their statements about Absolute Truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. All knowledge claims, according to the anekāntavāda doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied. The origins of anekāntavāda can be traced back to the teachings of Mahāvīra."</p>
<p>"The Jain doctrine of anekāntavāda... states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is naya, or 'partial expression of the truth'. Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around. One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is syāt, or valid 'in some respect' but it still remains a 'perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete'. In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced."</p>
<p>"Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a 'qualified yes'... The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer 'it is' or 'it is not' to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both 'it is' and 'it is not', with 'perhaps' qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute reality. The Jain doctrine of anekāntavāda, according to Bimal Matilal, states that 'no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation'."</p>
<p>"For example... all the following seven predicates must be accepted as true for a cooking pot, according to Matilal:</p>
<ul>
<li>from a certain point of view, or in a certain sense, the pot exists</li>
<li>from a certain point of view, the pot does not exist</li>
<li>from a certain point of view, the pot exists and does not exist</li>
<li>from a certain point of view, the pot is inexpressible</li>
<li>from a certain point of view, the pot both exists and is inexpressible</li>
<li>from a certain point of view, the pot both does not exist and is inexpressible</li>
<li>from a certain point of view, the pot exists, does not exist, and is also inexpressible"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Anekāntavāda</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To really understand this is to move into <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-yellow" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Yellow</a> integral Tier 2 cognition, where every perspective is seen as part-true, part-false. This requires letting go of the notion of there being totally wrong and totally right perspectives — a notion which the lower Spiral stages cling to vehemently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anekāntavāda is relativism, but it is also so much deeper than conventional notions of relativism because there is an Absolute. It just cannot be encapsulated in finite symbols or thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Jains have a really high quality epistemology. It's amazing that Mahavira figured this out 2500 years ago, before the earliest Greek philosophers were even born! Compared to the Hindus the Greeks were savages.</p>

<title>The Amazing Atheist</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-amazing-atheist</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A perfect example of how a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Orange</a> ego-mind justifies and defends its atheist, rationalist paradigm:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxCvkGuq6oo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice how the Amazing Atheist conflates mysticism with religion and fails to understand that Truth cannot be proven, symbolized, or communicated because a map is never the territory. He conflates actual Truth with linguistic or symbolic "truth".</p>
<p>It is indeed amazing how paradigm lock works.</p>
<p>This is a prime example of how closedmindedness and arrogance stymies any further inquiry or research into existential matters.</p>
<p>A more openminded person would wonder, "What could Hinduism be pointing to that I might be overlooking? Let me go research that."</p>
<p>Moral of the story is: don't become like this guy.</p>

<title>Astronaut Enlightenment</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/astronaut-enlightenment</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In the video below, US Apollo Astronaut and 6th man to walk on the moon, Edgar Mitchell, describes his samadhi experience in outer space.</p>
<p>"The presence of divinity became almost palpable, and I knew that life in the universe was not just an accident based on random processes... The knowledge came to me directly."</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UVuzDDTdgs?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Edgar Mitchell later founded the <a href="https://noetic.org/about/what-are-noetic-sciences" target="_blank">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a>, devoted to the study of consciousness. As the website says, "The essential hypothesis underlying the noetic sciences is simply that <em>consciousness matters</em>."</p>
<p>The point of this post is to help you realize that when the scientific mind penetrates reality deeply enough, the field of science morphs into the field of spirituality. A traditional scientist is just someone whose understanding of the metaphysical structure of reality is so thin that he hasn't realized yet that he IS reality! Oh sure, he knows it intellectually, but not deeply enough, not personally enough that it's flowered into a full-blown spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Flying into outer space helps to put you in touch with your own universal nature. Which is one of the key reasons why human beings are so fascinated with space exploration and space travel: We want to be Cosmic! But the truth is, we already are Cosmic! We've always been Cosmic! You don't need to fly into outer space to realize this because in fact there is no difference between outer space and inner space. The vacuum of outer space is already here, right now, inside your head! You can fly to the edge of the galaxy and all you will ever find is consciousness. But for a mind thoroughly locked in the materialist paradigm it might take something like flying to the moon to realize its folly. A materialist mind needs an epic material revelation of spirit/oneness/consciousness to break through the lock. Something akin to an angel descending down from the clouds with choir music playing.</p>
<p>A traditional scientist is a dabbler in reality. Sure, he knows some formulas and he's read a lot of books, but it has not dawned on him yet that the nature of reality is pure, radical subjectivity. So he stands too far aloof from his subject matter. He actually believes that the thing he's studying is separate from himself. He likes to pretend that he is being "objective". How myopic!</p>
<p>P.S. For you moon-landing conspiracy theorists, this is the most compelling evidence that the moon-landing actually happened. But sadly, if you're a moon-landing conspiracy theorist, understanding spirituality will be way over your head.</p>

<title>Catholic Collective Ego</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/catholic-collective-ego</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really good example of how collective ego works:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgAVX__2Igo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice how your own organization (whichever groups you're a part of) operates under the same basic dynamics. What people misunderstand is that the content of the group's beliefs is largely irrelevant. This is not a Catholic problem, this is a collective ego problem. Collective ego is a meta-structure. Its primary concern is self-preservation, regardless of what "the self" happens to be. It could be a religious self, a political self, a scientific self, a rational self, a gender self, a social justice self, an environmentalist self, etc. The Catholic Church, as a living, evolving organism — like every organism — is in a constant battle to keep itself alive. Because of this it tends to be blind to its own "ecological footprint" — AKA, selfishness.</p>
<p>The root solution to problems like this is genuine transcendence of ego — by increasing consciousness. Consciousness needs to be increased both at the individual level and at the collective level. But the catch-22 is, the ego does not want to increase consciousness because that means the death of the ego. And hence we have this perpetual battle between "good" and "evil", selfless vs selfish. You can't be completely selfless, or you will die. And you can't be completely selfish, or you will also die. The trick is striking the right balance, which complex organisms like humans and corporations and churches find very challenging to do.</p>
<p>Most organisms error on the side of selfishness because it is safer and easier. This is reinforced with fear and craving. The fear and craving which rules the Catholic Church also rules you. Which is fundamentally why you are so selfish.</p>
<p>It would take enormous courage for the Catholic Church to say: "From now on, full transparency". That would be the equivalent of you showing up to school or work naked. It's the last thing you want to do.</p>

<title>Hofstadter On Analogies &amp; Thinking</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/hofstadter-on-analogies-and-thinking</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vORB92BU7zk?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A Correction: I want to make a correction to something I said in my <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/understanding-sameness-vs-difference" target="_blank">Understanding Sameness vs Difference</a> video. In that video I made a minor point about how Douglas Hofstadter said that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> thinking boils down to analogy. This was a mischaracterization of his position. Rather, he says that analogy is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the core</span> of thinking, which is much more reasonable. My apologies for this oversight.</p>
<p>The only thing I would add to his excellent lecture above is that distinction is the other side of that coin. The core of thinking is both making analogies (seeing samenesses) and making distinctions (seeing differences). Both are crucial and work off each other, like the positive and negative ends of a battery.</p>

<p>Sikhism is larger than Judaism, yet most people have never heard of it.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to read what Sikhism is about on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism" target="_blank">Sikhism Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In Sikhism, the concept of God is Waheguru, considered Nirankar (shapeless), akal (timeless), and Alakh Niranjan (invisible). The Sikh scripture begins with Ik Onkar, which refers to the 'formless one'."</p></blockquote>

<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-apeiron-centre</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://apeironcentre.org/home" target="_blank">ApeironCentre.org</a></p>
<p>I found this obscure website devoted to the study of infinity. Really cool to see websites like this out there. The author (seen below) really gets it.</p>
<p>Read the long homepage text. It's got some profound insights there about the nature of reality.</p>

<title>Child Conservation Experiments</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/child-conservation-experiments</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Before you laugh at this child too much, just remember, you used to be this stupid too.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnArvcWaH6I?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>When a child like this is shown a video of himself doing these experiments once he's a few years older, he will deny that this is a video of the real him because in his mind there is no way that he could have been that stupid.</p>
<p>That's exactly how the ego-mind works. It always denies and disowns its own prior delusions and stupidities, because to admit them would introduce serious doubts about its present sense of reality.</p>
<p>To pull off a successful self-deception requires that you deny that self-deception is even a thing. Just to admit that self-deception is a serious possibility is already to half escape it.</p>
<p>Also, any deep insights the ego-mind has into the nature of reality are automatically backwards-rationalized as "obvious" and "self-evident" when in fact they weren't — they were significant and non-trivial discoveries. Which is why people these days are so naive about how science works. They think that discoveries like the orbiting Earth, the moons of Jupiter, germ theory, set theory, xrays, or heavier than air flight were obvious, "rational", and "scientific" when in fact they were considered pseudoscience.</p>

<title>The Supreme Purpose Of Life</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-supreme-purpose-of-life</link>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>"The Supreme Purpose Of Life Is The Ecstatical Vision Of God</p>
<p>Thus, in her ascension towards divinity, the soul advances until, having risen above everything that is foreign to her, she alone with Him who is alone, beholds, in all His simplicity and purity, Him from whom all depends, to whom all aspires, from whom everything draws its existence, life, and thought. He who beholds him is overwhelmed with love; with ardor desiring to unite himself with Him, entranced with ecstasy. Men who have not yet seen Him desire Him as the Good; those who have, admire Him as sovereign beauty, struck simultaneously with stupor and pleasure, thrilling in a painless orgasm, loving with a genuine emotion, with an ardor without equal, scorning all the other affections, and disdaining those things which formerly they characterized as beautiful. This is the experience of those to whom divinities and guardians have appeared; they reck no longer of the beauty of other bodies. Imagine, if you can, the experiences of those who behold Beauty itself, the pure Beauty, which, because of its very purity, if fleshless and bodiless, outside of earth and heaven. All of these things, indeed are contingent and composite, they are not principles, they are derived from Him. What beauty could one still wish to see after having arrived at vision of Him who gives perfection to all beings, though himself remains unmoved, without receiving anything; after finding rest in this contemplation, and enjoying it by becoming assimilated to him? Being supreme beauty, and the first beauty, He beautifies those who love Him, and thereby they become worthy of love. This is the great, the supreme goal of souls; this is the goal which arouses all their efforts, if they do not wish to be disinherited of that sublime contemplation the enjoyment of which confers blessedness, and privation of which is the greatest earthly misfortune of earthly misfortunes. Real misfortune is not to lack beautiful colors, nor beautiful bodies, nor power, nor domination, nor royalty. It is quite sufficient to see oneself excluded from no more than possession of beauty. This possession is precious enough to render worthless domination of a kingdom, if not the whole earth, of the sea, or even the heavens — if indeed it were possible, while abandoning and scorning all that (natural beauty), to succeed in contemplating beauty face to face."</p></blockquote>

<title>Merchants Of Doubt</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/merchants-of-doubt</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's an excellent documentary about how deception works; I recommend watching the full thing:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8ii9zGFDtc?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As you watch it, stay aware of following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deception is not merely something some "bad" people are doing to you, but an inherent function of ego. Although it may not seem like it, this documentary is really about how YOU deceive yourself.</li>
<li>Notice how individual ego and collective ego work hand-in-hand.</li>
<li>Notice how science & ego work hand-in-hand. There is no such thing as science without ego.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start to notice how individual ego, collective ego, rationality, science, politics, self-interest, and survival all work together — all working against truth. Because truth is dangerous to the entire enterprise of survival. Survival relies on deception, lying, illusion, and falsehood. This is NOT just something "evil" corporations do! This something YOU do! The very mechanisms that run these "evil" corporations are the very ones you must wrestle with inside yourself as you do self-actualization work. If you find self-actualization work difficult, now you know why these "evil" corporations run amok.</p>
<p>This is how the devil works. Through you.</p>
<p>And do not jump to the naive conclusion that "if only these oil companies weren't corrupting the science, science would have the truth." No! Self-deception is operating at every level of the mind. Even if the scientists are right in this case, they are still self-deceived just like the oil companies, just at higher levels. The deception is multi-dimensional. Escaping one deception does not mean you've escaped all levels of deception. For example, just because you've escaped the delusion of religious fundamentalism doesn't mean you've escaped the delusion of rationalism and scientism.</p>

<title>Hunter Maats Against Rationalism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/hunter-maats-against-rationalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's some advanced stuff which mostly went over Joe Rogan and his audience's head:</p>
<p>It's worth listening to the whole 3 hour talk.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZJwvRcaBaI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>What Hunter Maats talks about here is just the tip of the iceberg. He doesn't yet realize how deep it goes. It goes so deep that physical reality itself will collapse once you realize that it was just a cultural, conceptual, egoic construction all along. But that's a topic for another day.</p>
<p>Maats' critiques of Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins are on point.</p>

<title>How Capitalism Is Corrupting Science</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/how-capitalism-is-corrupting-science</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A very interesting discussion about the dirty realities of how science works:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1on3njRwdA0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Over the next 50 years, I foresee science becoming more and more biased by capitalistic forces, skewing our overall worldview to one which favors the corporate collective ego.</p>
<p>The materialist metaphysics that's prevalent in science doesn't just exist because it's reasonable, but because a mystical worldview is fundamentally threatening to business as usual ($$$). The materialist metaphysics helps business earn lots of money, and business re-invests this money back into more materialistic forms of research, creating a vicious circle of materialism, blind to higher consciousness truths.</p>
<p>So on the surface those people who trust in science (including the scientists themselves) end up thinking that materialism is getting more and more validated when in fact that's only happening because non-materialistic findings are being ignored because they don't feed the capitalist agenda. To put it simply, truth is bad for business.</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows that religion gets corrupted by ego because that's old news. What's new news is that science gets corrupted by ego in just the same way. The problem with atheists railing against religion is that it makes them blind to parallel dynamics occurring within science. The devil (ego) doesn't care whether your favorite ideology is religion or science. He will find a way to delude you with it all the same.</p>
<p>Always be skeptical when you hear an ego quoting scientific research as if it were objective fact. People like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Jordan Peterson come to mind here. People like that love to weaponize science to advance their own agendas.</p>
<p>P.S. Don't make the mistake that I am an enemy of science. Just the opposite. Every time I speak against science it's because I want science to be pure and unbiased. I speak against its corruptions and lack of self-awareness in the same way that Martin Luther spoke against the Catholic Church. But as always, the problem with calling out corruption inside any institution is that one gets seen as an enemy of that institution. Every institution has a collective ego which stubbornly defends itself — warts, corruption, and all.</p>

<p>So on the surface those people who trust in science (including the scientists themselves) end up thinking that materialism is getting more and more validated when in fact that's only happening because non-materialistic findings are being ignored because they don't feed the capitalist agenda. To put it simply, truth is bad for business.</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows that religion gets corrupted by ego because that's old news. What's new news is that science gets corrupted by ego in just the same way. The problem with atheists railing against religion is that it makes them blind to parallel dynamics occurring within science. The devil (ego) doesn't care whether your favorite ideology is religion or science. He will find a way to delude you with it all the same.</p>
<p>Always be skeptical when you hear an ego quoting scientific research as if it were objective fact. People like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Jordan Peterson come to mind here. People like that love to weaponize science to advance their own agendas.</p>
<p>P.S. Don't make the mistake that I am an enemy of science. Just the opposite. Every time I speak against science it's because I want science to be pure and unbiased. I speak against its corruptions and lack of self-awareness in the same way that Martin Luther spoke against the Catholic Church. But as always, the problem with calling out corruption inside any institution is that one gets seen as an enemy of that institution. Every institution has a collective ego which stubbornly defends itself — warts, corruption, and all.</p>
