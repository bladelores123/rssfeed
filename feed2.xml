<title>Soft White Underbelly</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/soft-white-underbelly</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A member of our forum — Rasheed — shared this amazing YT channel which I wanted to share more broadly here with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SoftWhiteUnderbelly" target="_blank">Soft White Underbelly</a></p>
<p>This channel features candid interviews with some fringe and far-out people. This channel will challenge your paradigm of mankind. Warning: Radical openmindedness required.</p>
<p>Here's a sampling of the kind of gold you'll find on there:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WN6Sb4SrK4c?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>So here's my challenge for you: Contemplate how you'd create a community that gets all of these people to co-exist together peacefully.</p>
<p>That's the real challenge of politics and government.</p>

<title>What Is Nationalism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/what-is-nationalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Much of the political turmoil we see today in the world can be simply explained as a battle between nationalism vs globalism. For thousands of years mankind has lived in communities separated from each other via geography, language, religion, race, culture, etc. But today, thanks to technology, each year, mankind is becoming more and more interconnected as one global community. This trend is inevitable and irreversible. But much of the world's population is running on the age-old nationalist operating system, thus resisting global integration. It's an matter of identity. Global integration requires relinquishing one's old, limited national identity — which feels threatening and uncomfortable for many people. So they invent all sorts of defense mechanisms to avoid it. These defense mechanisms include: judgment, blame, scapegoating, gaslighting, strawmanning, demonization, projection, denial, propaganda, lashing out, conspiracy theories, ridicule, righteous anger, violence, and fear.</p>
<p>I recommend you acquaint yourself with what the term "nationalism" means. It's good to have an explicit definition of it in your mind. It will explain a lot of what you will see going on around you during your lifetime.</p>
<p>Nationalism comes in many flavors and degrees. Read up on nationalism here:</p>

<title>The Mind Of God</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-mind-of-god</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a taste of what the mind of God feels like. It is pure, abstract, unstructured consciousness. Utterly impersonal and alien. Completely unlimited.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5YG5mktgmTg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The above is how I imagine an alien hyper-mind might work. Completely beyond ordinary human thought or logic. It would be highly multi-dimensional, highly non-linear, beyond verbal thought or communication.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIdakm0i1Pg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is what I mean when I say Infinite Imagination or Unlimited Consciousness or Universal Mind. The Universe is capable of imaging absolutely anything it wants. It has no logical or physical restrictions. There is literally nothing which is impossible to for it to imagine. The power of unlimited creativity, unlimited intelligence, unlimited sentience.</p>
<p>This is the raw engine which created your human life. This is God. This is what you are when not limited to your human body/mind.</p>

<title>House Of Saddam</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/house-of-saddam</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best shows HBO has ever released is the little-known House of Saddam. It's a 4-part mini-series about Saddam Hussein's rise to power. It's full of drama and insight into how brutal real-world politics are. Lots of great lessons there if you're trying to understand how societies develop. I highly recommend watching it. It's both education and seriously enjoyable. Perfectly cast and acted. Such an underrated show. Like Game of Thrones but without the dragons. It shows you how a society is governed at Spiral Dynamics stage Purple and Red.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JC3wgCYZul4?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>If you want to go even more in-depth, I recommend you read the Saddam Hussein book found in my book list. It will give you an even deeper understanding of how and why stage Red rises out of stage Purple.</p>

<title>Finding Your Niche</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/finding-your-niche</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a great discussion about the importance of finding your niche. This applies more broadly to career, life purpose, and/or business.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vid5yZRKzs0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes people make in biz is that they try to appeal too broadly and pleasing no one. Don't be afraid to be uniquely you, whether that's in your career choices or in your dating life. Offer the world something unique that only you can provide.</p>

<title>Feral Kitten Love</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/feral-kitten-love</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This video shows what I talked about in my recent video about how love, fear, and consciousness work.</p>
<p>A kitten (a fragment of Universal Consciousness) which didn't receive sufficient love during its birth will become terrified (fear) until it is healed again by a gentle application of love. Showing that love is the thing which heals dysfunctional beings. It works the same way for humans. But of course humans are much more complex and require even more care and attention to fully heal.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcD8DrJKejQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice how time-consuming it is and how much selflessness it requires. It's really hard to undo bad early childhood conditioning as it gets "baked" in the mind/brain.</p>
<p>Apply this lesson to how you see and interact with dysfunctional humans.</p>

<title>The Dao Of Love</title>

<p>Do not listen to nondual teachers who deny or don't acknowledge the centrality of Love in Awakening. There are some who would have you believe that love is merely an emotion or a second order thing. These people have not fully awoken. Their awakening is like a chocolate candy that's missing the gooey caramel filling.</p>

<title>Why Bernie Sanders Lost</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/why-bernie-sanders-lost</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>What progressives and Bernie supporters don't understand about how people vote:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/408718949?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="615" height="345" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Update: I didn't stress enough in this video how important personality and image is when people select the President. Yes, Spiral Dynamics alignment is crucial, but also personality and image is crucial. Don't overlook the possibility that many voters simply vote for a person who they are: A) familiar with, B) who fits their party, and C) who's looks and tone they like. In the case of John McCain vs Barrack Obama, for example, McCain just had the wrong image. Most people vote holistically, not based on any single policy issue. They evaluate a person's overall vibe and likeability. Because when you're uninformed, that's pretty much all you have to go on. And most voters are severely uninformed.</p>

<title>Everything Gained</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/everything-gained</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Everything gained will be lost.</p>
<p>Everything lost will be regained.</p>
<p>- - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>You will spend your life accumulating things, people, circumstances, positions, experiences, knowledge, success, money, power, sex, health, family, reputation, etc.</p>
<p>You will struggle desperately not to lose these things.</p>
<p>But you will lose them one by one. Causing you great suffering, especially in those cases where you think you cannot ever replace what was lost.</p>
<p>By the end of your life you will lose everything you gained, culminating in the final loss: birth itself.</p>
<p>And at the exact moment you complete the surrender of your birth, you will instantly regain everything and everyone you lost by merging with them in Infinite Consciousness, completing a perfect circle.</p>
<p>By losing your self you will find your Self.</p>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
<p>Life is a mirror for finding your True Self and suffering polishes this mirror.</p>

<title>Covid Love</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/covid-love</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Covid-19 has devastated the Vegas economy. The entire Strip will be shut down for a month, if not more, which is like shutting down the heart of this city. Tons of people losing their jobs. Everything in this town functions off socialization and large crowds, from the casinos to the restaurants to the strip clubs.</p>
<p>But yesterday I was doing my usual night drive around the city — when I drive for an hour and contemplate life — and as I drove thinking about what role Covid-19 plays in the larger scheme of the universe, I saw this out my window:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4570" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wynn-love-01.png" alt="wynn-love-01" width="625" /></p>
<p>That's it! It's that simple!</p>
<p>Most of the hotels on the Strip have gone dark, but they left a few rooms lit up in the shape of hearts.</p>
<p>Could the sign be any more obvious that this virus is not some mindless evil or pesky inconvenience, but a nudge towards our evolution to higher consciousness?</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the suffering, danger, and death is real. But that's the nature of Love. Love is not soft. <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/what-is-love-part-2" target="_blank">Love is relentless</a>. It will not yield to your smallness. Love is hard like a diamond.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1QONg2b2JQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Just because life becomes hard doesn't mean it isn't Love. Life gets hard precisely to show you how strong Love is.</p>
<p>Do not wish for life to get easier. Wish for your love to get stronger. Be BIGGER! Love wider!</p>
<p>Don't wait for God to light up hotel rooms in the shape of hearts for you to recognize Love.</p>
<p>People are sometimes baffled why I would choose to live in the city of sin. But if you can't find God in a strip club, you don't understand God.</p>
<p>"When we are divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us." — WHO director-general Dr. Tedros</p>
<p>As Covid-19 divides us, it brings us closer together into an ever deeper unity.</p>
<p>See my video: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/division-vs-unity" target="_blank">Division vs Unity</a></p>
<p>Pssst.... You'll never go wrong assuming it's ALL love ;)</p>

<title>Timothy Leary</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/timothy-leary</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you're someone who's interested in psychedelics as a tool for spiritual growth, I highly recommend reading the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on Timothy Leary</a> as it shows the dangers and problems that come with mainstreaming psychedelics.</p>
<p>There's a lot that happened in the 60's which the current generation has forgotten about or never understood. It's important to understand how the psychedelic revolution of the 60's went off the rails and why it sparked a backlash.</p>

It's really a thing of beauty. I have long wanted to make a mega-collection every closedminded ideological thing that mankind has ever said — as a teaching tool.</p>
<p>It's worth studying the RightWingWatch examples in detail. If I was a university professor of philosophy or epistemology, I would have an entire course where we study the epistemic stupidities of the right wing around the globe. And it would be one of the most popular and educational courses on campus.</p>
<p>Anyhow... Enjoy it, but not too much ;)</p>
<p>P.S. The left wing is not immune. It's just that the right wing is in a league of stupidity all on its own.</p>
<p>P.P.S. What RightWingWatch.org shows is that one of the best ways to combat ignorance is simply to put it on full display until the evidence becomes so overwhelming and obvious that no decent person can deny it. This is much more effective than argumentation or debate. Just show examples of stupidity and truth will prevail. Of course you must gather your examples in a fair-minded way, without taking things out of context and without promoting a counter-ideology. So it is possible for an ideologue to abuse this method. For example, the right wing loves to cherrypick the worst examples of left wing behavior on purpose to misrepresent the left wing and make the right wing look reasonable.</p>

<title>Social Distancing</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/social-distancing</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you are in the US, it's gonna get really bad in the next 2 weeks. Make sure you stay at home as much as possible. 20% percent of severe coronavirus cases are people between the age of 20 and 44.</p>
<p>If you are young and catch this virus, your chances of ending up in the emergency room is 1 in 5. No joke. And in 2 weeks you will be lucky if you can find a hospital in a major city with an open bed. You really want to avoid this thing.</p>
<p>Do not socialize. Do not hang around people. Do not touch objects outside your house without gloves. Do not come within 6 feet of people. Do not hang out in busy public places like restaurants or stores. Just get your groceries with gloves and go the fuck home.</p>
<p>Update: The following in-depth article was shared on the Forum by user Matt23:</p>

<title>Boost Your Immune System Now</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/boost-your-immune-system-now</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Corona virus public service announcement:</p>
<p>The virus seems to hurt most those with the weakest immune systems. The best thing you can do right now is to boost your immune system with supplements, vitamins, powerful antioxidants, and good nutrition. This should be done prior to infection and doubled down upon if you start noticing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Here are supplements I recommend you buy. I make no money off these supplements.</p>
<p>Basically anything which boosts your immune system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaga mushrooms (tincture or powder)</li>
<li>Mushroom immune support (tincture or pills; these usually contain a mix of many species)</li>
<li>Black Elberberry (tincture or pills)</li>
<li>Enchinacea (tincture or pills)</li>
<li>Garlic (pills)</li>
<li>NAC (pills)</li>
<li>L-Glutathione Reduced (pills)</li>
<li>Beta Glucan (pills)</li>
<li>Astaxanthin (12mg pills)</li>
<li>Vitamin C (1,000mg timed-release pills)</li>
<li>Vitamin D3 (5,000 IU softgells)</li>
<li>Colloidal silver (20-30PPM liquid bottle, not eyedropper or nasal spray)</li>
</ul>
<p>And generally, any other supplement which is proven to boost one's immune system. You can do some basic research to find others if the above are out of stock. There are also many different brands and many online stores besides Amazon (which might get sold out). You can buy these supplements individually or sometimes in various "immune booster" blends. Either way is fine. You can also buy them at local grocery stores, pharmacies, and vitamin shops. Sometimes finding them locally is easier, so don't give up hope if they are sold out online.</p>
<p>I suggest you stock on up on the above, take some daily for the next month or two, and triple down on the dosages if you start to feel sick. It is safe to mega-dose Vitamin C and Vitamin D3 for short periods of time. I would do so immediately if I felt sick. A mega-dose of Vitamin C might be 5,000mg to 10,000 per day and a mega-dose of Vitamin D3 might be 10,000 to 20,000 IU. I would only mega-dose a few days at a time if I was sure I was sick.</p>
<p>The government should really be passing out these supplements to everyone for free, but of course that's not gonna happen, so it's up to you to take responsibility for you and your family's health. Don't expect your doctor to know about these supplements. Doctors work within a very narrow-minded medical system, ignoring all natural and herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Note: I am not saying these supplements & vitamins are a "cure" for the corona virus. I'm merely saying your body will stand a much better chance of fighting the virus if you supply it with the raw nutrients it needs. Your recovery will hinge on the strength of your immune system, which hinges on your diet and nutrition. Taking these supplements on time could make the difference between having a mild flu vs ending up in the ER or dead. Raw juicing of fruits and veggies should also be helpful, although that requires going to the grocery store frequently, which isn't the best idea.</p>
<p>Don't panic, just get prepared and take this virus seriously. Start limiting your public exposure because this thing is gonna get a lot worse before it gets better. I would expect most countries to get locked down very soon.</p>
<p>This is also a great opportunity to become mindful of how SURVIVAL dominates all human thought and behavior, both individually and collectively. Notice just how wrapped up your mind is in survival. Your mind is not interested in truth, fairness, or love. It's interested in a warped, biased perception of reality which serves the narrow survival goals of your limited self-identity. From this one dynamic all the rest of your problems emerge.</p>

<title>Anand's Twitter</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/anands-twitter</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't spend much time on Twitter. But if you're gonna follow one political commentator, Anand Giridharadas is one of the best:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnandWrites" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/AnandWrites</a></p>
<p>His critiques of hyper-capitalism are sharp and devastating.</p>
<p>This is what serious progressivism looks like. Serious progressivism is not college kids protesting for trans rights. It's someone like Anand going for the jugular of unchecked capitalism. Everything else is a sideshow.</p>
<p>American capitalism is in the process of cannibalizing itself. But most elites are in denial about it because they want to keep milking the cow until it drops dead.</p>

<title>Build Your Skillz</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/build-your-skillz</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you want to break out of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-to-escape-wage-slavery" target="_blank">wage slavery</a> and become successful what you need is to develop serious skill, like this example. Skillz are how you become a somebody in the world.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyW12gDeWPI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Would you hire this guy if you needed some drawing work done? You couldn't say no! He's too good to be ignored. Everyone wants to work with skilled people. It is like honey that attracts all the ants.</p>
<p>You are not going to make it far in life without building a unique and powerful skill set. Building a skill set takes time, patience, focus, vision, and passion.</p>
<p>See my <a href="https://www.actualized.org/life-purpose-course" target="_blank">Life Purpose Course</a> for help finding your direction in life. It's very practical and gives you the core principles you need to move forward with building your unique skill set. Building a skill set takes a lot of time, so there's no time to waste. Get started now! The better your skill set the more money you will make, the more creative freedom you will command.</p>
<p>BTW, my skill set is articulating understanding. Not to brag, but I'm really, really good at it. Which is why you watch my videos. How did I get so good? I practiced it in my mind for 20+ years. Why did I do that? Because I love it.</p>
<p>So, Step #1: Find what you love and master the shit out of it.</p>
<p>Step #2: Profit!</p>
<p>If you live in a poor or underdeveloped country where life is difficult, your best way to rise out of that muck is to train up an incredible skill set. That is your passport to freedom. And yes, you can do it. But you need a clear vision and sense of direction.</p>
<p>The beauty of building a skill set is that it can be done virtually anywhere and it can be done virtually for free. You can build up an amazing skill set in a village in Iraq. Which allows you to bootstrap yourself from nothing to something.</p>
<p>So roll up your sleeves, lock yourself in a room, and build your skill set.</p>

<title>Tribe Meets White Man For First Time</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/tribe-meets-white-man-for-first-time</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Amazing raw footage! Try to put yourself in the epistemic position of the tribesmen. Notice how their minds simply cannot make sense of what is happening. That's because their limited paradigm cannot account for what is happening in their direct experience. It's very much like a psychedelic breakthrough trip. It's clearly real, but your mind has no clue how to explain it, and of course you're terrified it might be dangerous.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7a7IaS3ml4g?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is exactly what it's like for humans to meet advanced aliens. And exactly what it's like for humans to meet God. God can be present in your direct experience but your mind will not be capable of making sense of what God is, let alone how it is possible that God could be YOU!</p>
<p>Humans who have never had a breakthrough dose of psychedelics are like those tribesmen, with no clue of the world that exists outside their little tribal village.</p>
<p>This video is also what it's like for a materialist scientist to encounter mysticism. Mysticism is like that white man. It makes no sense to the rational mind because it's so much more advanced.</p>
<p>Teaching about God feels like being that white guy trying to give food to those terrified and puzzled tribesmen. Imagine trying to explain to them what a video camera is.</p>

<title>What The Hell Is Socialism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/what-the-hell-is-socialism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Great discussion which ties together concepts from my videos: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/conscious-politics-part-1" target="_blank">Conscious Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/understanding-relativism-part-1" target="_blank">Understanding Relativism</a>, and <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-society-evolves" target="_blank">How Society Evolves</a>.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6J3ROV4IPc?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>When it comes to understanding shifts on the political spectrum the key notion that people do not understand or explicitly state is Relativity. All political ideologies and positions are completely relative. So what looks "extreme" or "radical" left or right wing only appears that way given a particular vantage point. There is  no "radical" in the absolute sense. But this notion is too radical for mainstream news people to speak. A great confusion results when news people speak of liberal, centrist, or conservative positions as if these are fixed, absolute quantities. All scientific scales are relative, and even more so political scales, but this point is lost on mainstream news anchors.</p>
<p>There is no such thing, in politics, as staying in the middle. Because the very notion of "a middle" does not exist! "The middle" is always defined relative to the extremes. Your mind literally cannot know what "the middle" is unless it has extremes to contrast it with. And since the extremes are always moving, so is "the middle." By trying to stay in "the middle" you're actually naively fooling yourself that politics isn't changing when it is.</p>
<p>Yesterday's radicalism is today's "middle". And yesterday's "middle" is today considered barbaric or criminal. Don't forget, the middle between truth and falsehood is still falsehood. The middle between non-slavery and slavery is still slavery. So being in the middle is not as safe and sound as it first seems. Don't try to be in the middle. Try to be truthful, conscious, selfless, and loving. That is the best position. And in an ego-obsessed society, truth, consciousness, selflessness, and love are seen as radical.</p>

<title>Global Mind</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/global-mind</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Watch this time lapse of how the global mind is coming online:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6dkiqJ_IZGw?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the real meaning of globalization.</p>
<p>The Earth is wiring itself for unity — reaching out and reconnecting to lost parts of itself. Becoming more integrated and whole.</p>
<p>This is a poignant example of what I was talking about in my video: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/division-vs-unity" target="_blank">Division vs Unity</a>.</p>
<p>There is no stopping this. We cannot ever go back. The only way forward is ever-higher integration of the species.</p>
<p>Reminds me of this image which shows the mind's level of interconnectedness by default vs on a psychedelic:</p>

<title>Lula - Visionary Leadership</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/lula-visionary-leadership</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This is what visionary leadership sounds and looks like.</p>
<p>This is a speech by former Brazilian president Lula da Silva just before his unlawful imprisonment.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJm08zHWaKA?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>"There is no use in trying to stop my ideas."</p>
<p>"They're already in the air and you cannot imprison them."</p>
<p>"There is no point in trying to stop my dreams. Because when I stop dreaming I'll be dreaming through your minds and dreams."</p>
<p>"There's no point in thinking everything's going to stop the day Lula has a heart attack."</p>
<p>"That's nonsense."</p>
<p>"Because my heart will be beating through yours, and there are millions of hearts."</p>
<p>"The powerful can kill one, two, or 100 roses, but they'll never stop the arrival of spring."</p>
<p>- - - - - - - -</p>
<p>That is the power of Selflessness. It is the ultimate power. The power of God.</p>
<p>It touches your soul because deep down you feel the highest Truth is Selfless. And you yearn to be guided towards Truth despite all your devilry.</p>
<p>Talk about a man who understands that <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reproduction-is-an-illusion" target="_blank">reproduction is not limited to biology</a>.</p>

<title>Through The Looking Glass</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/through-the-looking-glass</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I want to introduce you to the phrase, "Through the looking glass". It's a great phrase to keep in mind if you're going deep into the existential work that we do here.</p>
<p>The phrase comes from the title of Lewis Carroll's famous novel, Through The Looking Glass, sequel to Alice In Wonderland. In the sequel Alice goes through the looking glass — looking glass is just an old fashioned word for a mirror — and of course discovers a strange and wacky alternative universe.</p>
<p>"Through the looking glass" is a metaphorical expression which means: on the bizarre side, in the twilight zone, in a strange parallel world where things are weird, loopy, and upside-down.</p>
<p>So what's the point?</p>
<p>The point is, consciousness has dimensions to it which are through the looking glass. Strange, bizarre, loopy, surreal, maddening. This physical dimension of conscious which we call Earth is just one tiny dimension out of infinite others which are not limited by the laws of physics, logic, or even sanity. These strange realms can be scary and shocking to the unprepared mind that only expects reality to fit its narrow logical categories. It's important to keep this in the back of your mind as you start doing spiritual work. Be prepared that one day you will find yourself through the looking glass. When it happens to you, don't freak out, don't panic. Stay calm and remind yourself that this was supposed to happen. This was the point of your work.</p>
<p>Especially you're going to use psychedelics you'll come to appreciate the significance of this phrase. Keeping these words in the back of your mind might help you to avert a bad trip.</p>
<p>What do you do when you suddenly find yourself through the looking glass? Enjoy the scenery, like an explorer in some uncharted land. As Terence McKenna said, "God is some kind of lost continent in the human mind." Or more accurately, the human mind a tiny island in the mind of God.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A new logo for Actualized.org has been in works for several years. It took a long time because I wanted to come up with something I'd be really happy with. Then, after much brainstorming and searching, finally in a trip it came to me.</p>
<p>So here it is:</p>

<p>It represents Maslow's Pyramid of Needs, which was the originating idea behind the whole site, but now with the final step of transcendence.</p>
<p>It is an interesting story that when Maslow first created his pyramid of needs, the highest stage — the pinnacle — he called Self-Actualization. But then in the final years of his life he added one last stage, which he called Transcendence, which of course stands for enlightenment. That's where your whole journey ends. Or should we say begins, as everything goes full-circle with Transcendence, where beginning and end merge into One.</p>
<p>In the end your journey will end exactly where it began, but everything will be different as God has been actualized.</p>

<title>Wicked Strange Loop</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/wicked-strange-loop</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>User "<a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14162-yog/" target="_blank">Yog</a>" on the forum found this amazing <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">strange loop</a> that I wanted to share with everyone:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/strange-loop-stone-01.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4522" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/strange-loop-stone-01.gif" alt="strange-loop-stone-01" width="320" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>That's how the ultimate nature of reality is. God created itself, without a beginning or end.</p>
<p>Impossible, yet here you are.</p>
<p>If your rationality cannot handle strange loops, your rationality will not be sufficient to understand reality (not even conceptually, never mind actually). The origin of reality exists in a place where formal logic cannot go. That's because formal logic cannot handle self-reference / self-reflection.</p>
<p>You have to learn to think in ways that accommodate paradox and strange loops.</p>
<p>And if you ever want to understand God fully, know this: complete comprehension of God will obliterate your whole mind. You will literally not be able to think your name or your birth any more. All explanations of reality will get expunged in the stark light of pure God-consciousness until only Void remains. Notions such a time, space, matter, humans, objects, history, science, cause & effect, logic, life, birth, death, will all be annihilated and transcended. You will be left dumb and mute.</p>
<p>Absolute Infinity, Absolute Truth, Absolute Love</p>

<title>Are You A Light Worker?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/are-you-a-light-worker</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I know, I know, it sounds so New Agey, but this term "light worker" is quite informative if you happen to be one but don't realize it yet.</p>
<p>Here's a list of 20 qualities of light workers:</p>
<p><a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2018/03/20-signs-youre-whats-known-as-a-lightworker/" target="_blank">20 Signs That You Are A Light Worker</a></p>
<p>If that's you, it's important to recognize it early and structure your life accordingly. As a light worker you cannot live the typical traditional life that everyone around you is living. You are different and you need to carve out a unique path in life which honors your unique values, strengths, and abilities.</p>
<p>If you're a light worker but you're trying to live a traditional life, you're going to suffer a lot without knowing what exactly is wrong.</p>
<p>If you identify as a light worker, you should really take my <a href="https://www.actualized.org/life-purpose-course" target="_blank">Life Purpose Course</a>, it was designed just for you. It's not easy to live a life of purpose because society does not teach you how. I created the course after figuring out how to do it for myself.</p>

<title>On Devilry</title>

<title>Register To Vote 2020</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/register-to-vote-2020</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you're American, it's important you vote in the upcoming Democrat primaries. It's important not just for America's sake but for the world.</p>
<p>It's no longer good enough to only vote in the November General Election. You must get active in the primaries.</p>
<p>It's not too late. Go register. Some states require that you register as a Democrat to participate in the primary. Do that if you must. I did. You can always unregister afterwards. Mark the date of the primary on your calendar. Many states have early voting, so mark that on your calendar. Voting is super easy in most places.</p>
<p>Now, the million dollar question: Who should you vote for?</p>
<p>Vote for the person who is most conscious, most loving, most Spirally developed, AND who has a reasonable chance of winning. Don't throw your vote away on candidates polling at <5%.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, you will only vote as high as your Spiral stage of development allows. If you are Blue-Orange, you will like Biden and Klobuchar. If you are solid Orange you will like Bloomberg and Buttigeg. If you are Orange-Green you will like Warren, Yang, Tulsi, Steyer. If you are solid Green and above you will like Bernie. If you are solid Orange or below you will likely hate Bernie.</p>
<p>Remember, your vote is 90%+ determined by your level of consciousness and nothing else. The rest is bullshit excuses your mind is making up to justify your position. All of your justifications are coming from your level of consciousness and nothing else. You can't help reveal your true colors by who you vote for. There is nothing original about what your mind is doing.</p>
<p>Personally I endorsed Bernie Sanders 1 year ago and I'm sticking to it.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to donate money now if you can to the candidate of your choice. But don't fool yourself: a donation is not a substitute for voting in the primary. Voting is crucial and if you really care about the development of mankind, it is your duty to vote for the most developed humans to run society.</p>
<p>Important issues are at stake:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rise of nationalism & authoritarianism</li>
<li>The perpetuation of soulless, unchecked, unjust, and unsustainable capitalism</li>
<li>Environmental destruction that will affect mankind for a century to come</li>
<li>The perpetuation of a corrupt healthcare system that kills tens of thousands needlessly every year</li>
<li>War with Iran</li>
<li>The senseless drug war</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>The time for talking and squabbling is over. Now is time for action at the ballot box. Encourage your friends and family to do the same.</p>

<title>Please Let Me Rob You, I'm Woke</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/please-let-me-rob-you-im-woke</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for the repeated Anand talks, but I'm just addicted listening to him speak on neoliberalism. He's so good at articulating the current stage Orange/Green transition that the developed world is going through:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KBlH269dIs?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is a discussion about the end of Stage Orange. Picture a numb rat gnawing its own tail to the bone until one day it suddenly realizes: "Oh! That's my tail I've been gnawing on!" That is how stage Orange transitions into stage Green.</p>
<p>But really what Anand talks about is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The role of good public intellectuals is to question and deconstruct the myths of prior generations to create a new upgraded culture that shapes how people think about things to enable the next level of society.</p>
<p>An outdated culture leads to people thinking and acting in foolish and self-destructive ways en masse because most people simply follow whatever culture they are programmed with in their youth. Average people need visionary yet down-to-Earth intellectuals to shows them new ways to think about the world. Yes, even CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, politicians, and big name scientists need visionary intellectuals to show them how to think. Being successful or well-respected does not make you a good thinker. Often just the opposite because the culture most-rewards those who reinforce the status quo, not those who challenge it. The thing is, a Fortune 500 CEO is not thinking deeply about how to think deeply. He's just acting out old thinking routines that got him to where he is, but won't get him higher.</p>
<p>What isn't well understood is that the next level of society doesn't just come automatically through better technology. There needs to be new intellectual architecture put in place because the old intellectual architecture can only take us so far. More technology without an upgraded intellectual architecture is like giving chainsaws to children.</p>
<p>Right now we are living in an era where the old intellectual architecture is starting to strain and buckle under its own weight.</p>
<p>The role of Actualized.org is to build and popularize new intellectual architecture. These teachings are not just here to help you personally master your life but to create new ways of thinking that will enable the next 100-500 years of societal evolution. Which is why I use a lot of political examples nowadays in my teachings. I'm trying to show you that personal development and social development are deeply interconnected so that once you do self-actualize, you will link your self-actualization, awakening, and success to the uplifting of mankind. So your growth, your awakening, your life purpose, and your career/biz will all be integrated. This is going to be more and more necessary in the future. The days of going to a dead-end job and punching the clock are coming to an end. Factory jobs are coming to an end. The jobs of the future will require passion, self-determination, creativity, and consciousness. What do we do when robots take all our menial jobs? We train and develop ourselves to be powerful creatives, artists, visionaries, leaders, and lovers. We develop those things which robots don't have (at least yet): creativity, vision, artistry, intuition, wisdom, consciousness, empathy, humanity, spirit, love. But this cannot happen on auto-pilot. This requires that everyone consciously participate in crafting their life from any early age. And this requires that people be shown how to do this. Someone needs to take them by the hand and lead them through the process. And even beyond that, society needs to build new infrastructure that makes this process easy, natural, and normal — so your peers aren't looking at you like some freak for doing this. Right now these systems haven't been built yet, which is why it's so difficult. Most humans are only used to doing things which mankind has already well-pioneered. Something like going to school is only easy these days because social systems were pioneered for several thousand years. If you had to do school on your own, without social support, less than 1% of people would do it. It would be 100x harder.</p>
<p>The most important thing we need to train our children is how to connect their passion for life with life-long self-education, a career grounded in on a sense of life purpose, personal development, spiritual development, and then also social development. Without these kinds of citizens society is ineffective and dysfunctional as the majority of people are not passionate about their personal lives and therefore disengaged from being of service to others.</p>
<p>Imagine a society in which a majority of citizens are passionate about their careers and their careers are about being of genuine service to others, not just mindless profiteering or widget-making. That is the future, but it will be a rocky transition to get there. Design your life to fit into this mold of the future.</p>
<p>Those billionaires and Fortune 500 CEOs might seem like they are living a life of purpose, but they are not. They are living an unconscious life of chasing success and status, which is not the same as life purpose. Life purpose is how you would do conscious work if success, money, and status were irrelevant.</p>

<title>&quot;Flood The Zone With Shit&quot;</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/flood-the-zone-with-shit</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I love how transparent Steve Bannon is about his devilry:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- Steve Bannon</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation" target="_blank">Vox Article - How Misinformation Overwhelmed Our Democracy</a></p>
<p>In a sense this makes him an ineffective devil because he's too honest about his devilry. Devilry can't survive long in transparency. It has to be opaque.</p>
<p>But anyway, that is precisely how devilry works. It perpetuates falsehood simply by muddying the waters so much that average people cannot tell the difference between truth and falsehood. This is a broader tactic of devils that takes place not only in politics but with religion and spirituality. Many people these days are so sour on religion, spirituality, and anything smacking of the New Age because these important zones have been flooded with shit over the centuries. This makes it very difficult for people to find Truth/God. The zone has been so flooded with shit that most people think that Truth and God a myth. And in such a state, the devil wins. The devil doesn't need a proper victory — in fact he can never get one because devilry is falsehood — but he can squeak out a short-term psuedo-victory by muddying the waters.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for those in society who make careers out of muddying the waters. Don't become pawns in their game. To have a high-functioning society it's crucial that public figures don't manipulate truth for personal gain.</p>

<title>Is Gender Real?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/is-gender-real</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Male/female is a duality. And if you've been following along with my videos, you should understand by now that all <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/understanding-duality-part-1" target="_blank">dualities</a> (without exception) are untenable and groundless and must collapse at some point. This is a fundamental principles of reality. But all this sounds so philosophical and abstract that people still cannot wrap their minds around how something as concrete and "physical" as male and female could be a collapsable duality. Aren't males just clearly males and females just clearly females? Of course not! And this has nothing to do with political correctness or LGBTQ rights. This is an existential matter.</p>
<p>Here is the starkest proof:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8S79UN856EE?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Ask yourself this existential question: at what precise point did this fish go from female to male? And if a female fish can turn into a male fish, what does that mean for the categories of "male" and "female"? In what sense are they real? What are these categories grounded in?</p>
<p>And before you make a rebuttal such as, "Well, but these fish aren't human so they don't count", remember that fish vs human is also a duality! Which is also ultimately groundless and must collapse:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6ruIZYddhk?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Ask yourself this existential question: at what point does an organism go from being a fish to being human? Do such categories exist outside of your mind?</p>
<p>The above examples are perplexing to people who believe in absolute rigid categories, but they are totally expected to people who understand that all categories are relative dualities which are destined to collapse when stretched far enough.</p>

<title>What Corruption Looks Like</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/what-corruption-looks-like</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Amazing interview, showing how <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-corruption-works" target="_blank">corruption</a> happens behind the scenes:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JKraI_Rh6g?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Of course this is exactly as one would expect Trump's influence to be. His massive ego is like the gravity well of Jupiter, pulling in every other ego in the region and corrupting it. That's how corruption spreads itself. It lures in the greedy and the ignorant with promises of quick and easy wealth, power, fame, and sex — all the things an ego craves the most. Trump's Washington hotel is an actual den for the congregation and breeding of devils.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/what-is-the-devil" target="_blank">how devilry works</a>.</p>
<p>Good work here by CNN. Without this kind of transparent reporting devils would run rampant. Notice how devils can only survive in the shadows. They cannot survive long in the light. Which is why there is such an attack these days on the media. Once a bunch of devils get into power, their first job will be to corrupt every source of light and transparency. Devils must create a shadowy environment in order to roost. That's exactly what Trump has been doing from day one with his "fake news" campaign.</p>

<title>TurboTax Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/turbotax-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045779/irs-turbotax-free-file-h-r-block-tax-preparation-new-rules" target="_blank">IRS Puts A Stop To TurboTax Corruption</a></p>
<p>The above news story explains how Inuit, maker of the popular tax filing software TurboTax, spent millions of dollars to lobby the US government against easy and free tax filing options. That's is devilry 101. That's how self-bias corrupts all governments.</p>
<p>Intuit is a publicly traded company with a market cap of $69 billion, $2.25 billion cash-on-hand, 8,2000 employees, and the CEO's salary is $21 million per year . Yet they cannot help rigging the government in their favor, regardless of how it hurts average citizens. Because their concern is not what's best for the citizens but what is best for Intuit. Why does the CEO get paid $21 million per year? Precisely because he works night and day to ensure that such devilry passes successfully. But of course he is not conscious of what he is doing. In his mind all of this is justified as normal, necessary, and even good. Because it is good! It's good for his survival which is linked to the survival of the company. You don't earn $21 million per year by being nice. You earn it by being a devil.</p>
<p>Now imagine that this is happening on a massive scale, with thousands of companies rigging the government to increase their profits. Now it's apparent why government is so ineffective and stuck. It's being debased from a thousands sides by a thousand parties.</p>
<p>Our government is like a noblewoman turned cheap whore, getting fucked in every orifice by an eager gaggle of desperate men. But if you stop and ask any one particular man in the gaggle whether there is any problem with this situation, he will say No, because it is normal, all his friends are doing it, the gaggle is 1000 men long, and how else is he supposed to get his needs met? And of course his need is insatiable. You'd think $21 million per year would be enough to be satisfy, but that only whets the appetite. And beside which, even if one of them quit in disgust, another one would eagerly take his place.</p>
<p>This is why getting money out of politics is the #1 most important political reform. And also why it's the most difficult.</p>

<title>Taking A Break</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/taking-a-break</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have decided to take a break from releasing videos for a while to rejuvenate my creative juices and work on myself. 7 years of constantly releasing videos with hardly any breaks takes its toll on creativity — which is one of my highest values. Yes, YouTuber burnout is a genuine phenomenon. The ever-present low-grade stress of having to constantly release great and original videos for years on end starts to eat away at the soul and feels creatively stifling — like being a one-trick pony. I have multiple creative projects and research projects which I want to work on besides releasing videos, and since the videos are so labor intensive and constant, this prevents me from working on other things that I'm passionate about, including my own development. For the kind of work that I do there needs to be a delicate balance between outer work and inner work. Outer work is work I do for you — for the world to consume. Inner work is work I do for myself which nobody directly sees, but which shapes the totality of my outer work in the future. So what I'm doing now is shifting priority from outer work to inner work. This means less immediate creative output, but laying a deeper foundation for the future.</p>
<p>I plan to take at least 1 month off, starting from last week.</p>
<p>And I have decided to make this a new yearly habit. From now on, every year I will take at least 1 month off purely for personal time — not for meditation retreats or others rigorous work, but just unplanned personal time. I find this is essential to do if you are highly creative person. You just cannot be at peak creativity 365 days of the year. That's not a good schedule for highly creative people. Counter-intuitively, more becomes less and less becomes more. So for now I'm planning to take the entire month of December off each year, but I may adjust that in the future to some other month or even months, depending on what my psyche calls for.</p>
<p>Fear not, I'll be back with more videos and new insights soon. There are literally 100s of important topics yet to cover. We just have to pace ourselves properly, as this is not a sprint but a marathon.</p>
<p>I will still be somewhat active on the forum, and the rest of the site will still be fully operational, so if you want to buy the book list or the Life Purpose Course, all of that still works.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support and for sticking with me through the highs and lows.</p>

<title>US Assassinates Top Iranian Leader</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/us-assassinates-top-iranian-leader</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well, the greatest concern about Trump's presidency — him starting a foolish war — has finally come to fruition.</p>
<p>Imagine if Iran had assassinated the US Vice President while he was traveling in a Canadian airport. That's the equivalent of what happened.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Z0XjA0tWko?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>An accurate headline in today's morning paper would read: "US Assassinates Top Iranian Leader In Act of War". But you will not see such a headline in the US media because of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/self-bias" target="_blank">Self-Bias</a>. Of course the US will spin this as "self-defense". That's an interesting phrasing since "self-defense" — as in, ego-defense — is what this is really about. The ego always justifies its devilry as self-defense, even when it is aggression. Because the ego's notion of "self-defense" is infinitely elastic and self-biased.</p>
<p>Egotistical, unconscious, and ignorant leaders cannot help themselves start wars. Bush and Trump are cases in point. Dumb and dumber.</p>
<p>The current situation is the direct result of Trump's and the Republicans' eagerness to tear up the Iran nuclear agreement. It was obvious to even an uninformed laymen that reneging on that agreement was a very bad idea. And of course the opposition to that agreement was an act of ego.</p>
<p>It is the duty of conscious citizens to stand up and say, Not in our name! American citizens should not tolerate such devilry from our own. This is what being objective and truthful means in the real world. It is the ability to call out the self-bias and wrong-doing of your own team as soon as it happens, not giving them a pass because they are closer to you. A devil is a devil, even if he sleeps in the bed next to you.</p>

<title>Survival In A Nutshell</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/survival-in-a-nutshell</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I like how this tiny clip shows the whole predicament of survival in a nutshell:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WySwhj2SwE?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>What did this lady want? Love. But look how greedy she became when she didn't get the love she wanted. Then look how the Pope reacted to someone taking his love by force. That's survival on both sides.</p>
<p>This is what parents are doing to children; children are doing to parents; spouses are doing to spouses; businesses are doing to customers; customers are doing to businesses; businesses are doing to businesses; nations are doing to nations.</p>

<title>Love, Death, and Robots</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/love-death-and-robots</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the holiday break my brother showed me this series on Netflix called Love, Death, and Robots. It's a collection of 18 short sci-fi stories in animated form. What pleasantly surprised me was the depth and quality of the storytelling.</p>
<p>Three of the episodes caught my attention as having some profound spiritual significance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beyond The Aquila Rift — the ending is profound in that it shows that truth can be an ugly thing which most people don't have the courage to stomach. Most people don't realize how shocking and radical truth is, which is why it must remain hidden. Before you ask for the truth, make sure you can handle it. Tis a good life lesson.</li>
<li>Zima Blue - the entire arc of Zima-the-artist shows the interconnection between art, spirituality, and truth. Most artists don't realize that what they're really seeking with their art is Spirit. Zima found it, but it cost him his life. And of course his final deconstruction was shocking to everyone watching. Zim's arc is the spiritual path in a nutshell.</li>
<li>The Witness — the ending is a delicious <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">strange loop</a>. If you're still not clear what a strange loop is, here it is.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you watch these three episodes, my commentary above will start to make sense.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer for the show, although I think the trailer sucks at selling it, so don't judge by the trailer. You must watch to understand.</p>

<title>Racial Unity</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/racial-unity</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a selfish argument against racism and nationalism: if all the world's races interbreed, humans will literally become more beautiful and sexually attractive. Have you noticed that mix-raced people tend to be more hot?</p>
<p>Here's the proof. These images represent the averaged faces of every major ethnicity. Averaging faces (blending/unifying them) makes them more attractive to the human eye. Now imagine if we did a meta-average of all the ethnicities into one face. So, to put it starkly, it's in your best interest for all races to fuck each other ;)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/average_face_women.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4484" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/average_face_women.jpg" alt="average_face_women" width="615" /></a></p>

<p>Just be careful, his position of materialism, atheism, and anti-mysticism is delusional. He does not know what he's talking about when he speaks of God, consciousness, or love. The rest is good.</p>

<title>The Dirty Secrets Of Capitalism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-dirty-secrets-of-capitalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Unlike most billionaires, this billionaire is doing a great job at overcoming his self-bias:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th3KE_H27bs?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We need more millionaires and billionaires to speak out against the devilry of neoliberal economics. Unfortunately most of them are so comfy it makes them blind to the systemic rigging. A lot of millionaires and billionaires hold libertarian and capitalist ideologies because that's what serves their survival, and allowed them to rise to the top.</p>
<p>It would be almost impossible for someone who's conscious of the devilry of neoliberalism to run a giant Fortune 500 company like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Disney, Exxon, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, AT&T, etc. To run such companies requires that management and investors bullshit themselves about how good and fair it all is. All of these companies need to believe that giant monopolies, low taxes, and deregulation are good for society. Without such a positive mythology, management and investors would have an existential and moral crisis.</p>

<title>Misunderstanding Love</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/misunderstanding-love</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This short clip epitomizes how <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Stage Blue</a> misunderstands <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">Stage Green</a>:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGuYEDEkIPY?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I love this clip because it so clearly demonstrates how the ego-mind can literally see love and peace as "evil". That's the essence of devilry: to call love evil and truth falsehood. When a devil sees or hears love, he calls it evil. When a devil sees or hears truth, he calls it falsehood. He does all this unconsciously with an air of smug self-righteousness. And then he actively rallies those in his circle to his distorted perspective, as this allows the distortion to take on the appearance of truth. This is the universal mechanism of devilry. Learn it well because you will see this over and over again throughout your life.</p>
<p>Genuine morality is not a set of man-made rules to follow. Genuine morality is the recognition of Self-Love. It cannot be written down in a book or even taught. The trick with teaching Love is that although it sounds simple, childish, utopian, and airy-fairy, it's actually the most advanced of teachings because it requires of the student a certain level of consciousness and being. To someone at a low level of consciousness, a teaching about Love will seem utopian, unscientific, immoral, and even evil. Which is why someone like Jesus, if he were alive today, would actually be demonized by the right-wing as a communist SJW.</p>
<p>Of course the Beatles did a lot of LSD, so they had direct mystical experiences of Love — which they then sang about. But none of this fits a right-wing rule-based view of morality. Which is of course why LSD and other psychedelics were quickly outlawed in a predominantly stage Blue society (1960s). Psychedelics are the single greatest threat to people like Ben Shapiro (Stage Blue) and what's more, they don't even know it. They just instinctively stay far away from it. See, the ego-mind is so good a self-deception that it can stay far away from things that threaten its worldview without the person even having to consciously understand why. The ego-mind will rationalize it in a way that only entrenches one deeper in one's paradigm, making the self-deception indistinguishable from reality and almost inescapable.</p>
<p>How do you validate Spiral Dynamics? With examples like this. It's remarkable how well Spiral Dynamics explains and predicts such examples. It's like people operate on just a handful of scripts: Blue, Orange, Green << that explains 80% of current human behavior! Amazing, huh?</p>

<title>Exposing Neo-Liberal Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/exposing-neo-liberal-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Tis a thing of beauty to watch Anand Giridharadas demolish the neo-liberal fantasy.</p>
<p>This is what exposing devilry looks like:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7m2AumufJfw?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>This is a top-notch example of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">Stage Green</a> at its healthiest and most cogent. This is what Jordan Peterson and his fanboys are missing. This is what JP smears as "Cultural Marxism". This is what the right-wing is in denial about. This is what the culture wars are distracting from. This is the real political discussion that is never shown on TV.</p>
<p>Neither nationalism, nor libertarianism, nor technology, nor higher economic growth can solve this problem. We face a new set of collective challenges which require a Stage Green worldview to start to address.</p>
<p>BTW, if you're not in America, you might wonder, "But Leo, how do your American examples help me?" Not so fast! The principles we're studying here in these mostly American examples apply to all countries. If you're in a less developed country then these are the problems you'll face once your country reaches peak Stage Orange like America. And it will happen sooner than you think. Maybe it will take 50 years, but your country will face these same problems, and probably already is. That's what Spiral Dynamics shows us. That's the value of studying structure. Don't get hung up on local details. China, India, Russia, Brazil... they're all gonna have to find solutions to corporatism run amok, gross income inequality, and what is fundamentally plutocracy.</p>

<title>Former Users Describe Heroin High</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/former-users-describe-heroin-high</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>To be clear, I don't recommend you ever experiment with heroin or opioids because they are super addictive and run counter to our work.</p>
<p>But it's psychologically and metaphysically illuminating to read about why people do heroin:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwxkbv/ex-users-describe-the-first-time-they-tried-heroin" target="_blank">Vice.com - Former Users Describe the First Time They Tried Heroin</a></p>
<p>The bottom line is: people do heroin because it brings them closer to God, and they don't know of any other healthy way of getting there. Most of them don't even know that what they're connecting with is God. That's how ignorant the situation is.</p>
<p>God is the greatest high in the world. What do you think monks, mystics, and yogis are chasing? They are heroin addicts minus the heroin.</p>
<p>Once you experience God, no other feeling will satisfy you. And in true going-full-circle fashion, that's how the best thing in the world becomes the worst thing in the world. Heaven becomes hell. So the wise find ways of reaching heaven without the life-shattering side-effects. It takes more work, but it's worth it.</p>
<p>P.S. Psychedelics can take you even closer to God than heroin and are anti-addictive. But they will still leave you with the suffering and heartbreak of losing your connection to God after the trip ends. Of course your connection to God cannot ever truly be lost because you are God. But you will lose awareness of this basic fact, sucked back into the Matrix of ego and social obligation.</p>

<title>The Complexity Of Life</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-complexity-of-life</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Biologists are only starting to get an idea of how complex and astounding life truly is:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9euW5iCjKDo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>"I still remember the moment. It's something I will never forget. The hair on my hands just stood up."</p>
<p>Why did the hair on his hands stand up? Because his mind caught a glimpse of Infinite Intelligence. That's God! But he doesn't realize that yet since he's looking at these cells from the materialist paradigm. How much more awesome it becomes when you realize that these cells are occurring within an Infinite Mind — what's more — YOUR Infinite Mind, created by You!</p>
<p>When some spiritual fool tells you life is simple, remember this video. Life is infinitely complex, and the only way it can work at all is because it is managed by an Infinite Intelligence that tracks every single detail with infinite precision, perfectly.</p>
<p>Only a naive human can convince itself that this whole process can be modeled and analyzed by the human mind. No model will ever do it justice. This is just the tip of an infinite iceberg.</p>

<title>Manufacturing Consent</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/manufacturing-consent</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Noam Chomsky has done some excellent work exposing how the media serves as a self-deception and reality-construction machine for the survival of the status quo and various collective egos.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34LGPIXvU5M?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTBWfkE7BXU?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>If you want to learn more, you can read Chomsky's classic book: <a href="https://amzn.to/2DhJeXq" target="_blank">Manufacturing Consent</a>. It's a great lesson in how self-biased American media is. But of course this dynamic isn't only limited to American media. It's all media worldwide. In fact, the less developed the country, the more self-biased and corrupt the media tends to be. America is actually one of the best, compared, say, to Russia, China, or Iran.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing about this entire ideological machine is that the people at the top are not themselves conscious of what they are doing. The people in positions of power most engaged in deceiving the masses are themselves fully self-deceived. Chasing money & profits, as media elites and CEOs like to do, is the chief self-deception.</p>
<p>The key mistake that conspiracy theorists make is that they give those at the top too much credit. They assume those at the top are acting consciously and intelligently, but actually, they are the blind leading the blind. The media executives, the shareholders, the CEOs, the presidents, the VPs, the millionaires, the billionaires, the tech tycoons... they're all very unconscious people. They just happen to be great at manipulating and making money — which must be distinguished from true intelligence and consciousness.</p>
<p>Society is a conspiracy of idiots who are so ignorant they do not understand that they have formed a conspiracy to deceive each other! — a circular firing squad of ignorance. And the conspiracy theorists are some of the biggest idiots of the bunch, feeding the cycle even further by distracting from the root issues. Plot twist: conspiracy theorists are the false flag! This machine of ignorance is so deep and wide-spread that it's almost impossible for any one conscious human to dismantle or change. Small efforts at reform are made around the edges by visionaries and sages, but this takes decades and centuries to be felt. Which is why something like awakening or God cannot be made mainstream. Awakening is the most dangerous thing to this whole machine because Truth cannot be monopolized for profit or power. Which is why awakening is not taught in schools and universities. Of course schools and universities are all part of this machine, since indoctrinating the children is the most important piece of the self-deception.</p>
<p>This is the cleverness and devilry with which the illusion of self is maintained. Quite jaw-dropping when you realize it for what it is. It takes so much energy to maintain this house of cards. And all ultimately because... fear of death, fear of love, fear of God.</p>
<p>Of course it does no good to demonize all this, as that only adds to the problem of ignorance. You must accept all this as what you are and approach the problem with compassion for all involved.</p>
<p>The biggest business in the world is not oil or computers, it's eyeballs. He who controls the most eyeballs controls the world. See my videos: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/the-deep-problem-of-marketing" target="_blank">The Deep Problem Of Marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-to-escape-wage-slavery" target="_blank">How To Escape Wage Slavery</a>.</p>

<p>"We're in <del>soul</del> ego business here."</p>
<p>Seem absurd? Structurally, your mind does exactly the same thing every day. Does this kind of thing outrage and baffle you? That's because you do it yourself! But of course you deny it. You get offended and upset that you might have any structural likeness to the above example. You project your own self-bias onto others as outrage so that you can feel innocent and righteous by comparison.</p>
<p>See how sneaky your devil mind is?</p>
<p>Justification, self-bias, devilry — these are all structural. Don't get distracted by the content of private jets or religion. This has nothing to do with private jets or religion. This is all about survival. You might be the most rational, scientific person in the world, and still you do this kind of self-justifying structurally.</p>

<title>Inside The Psyche Of Stage Red</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/inside-the-psyche-of-stage-red</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a candid real-world account of what it's like to work for a Spiral Dynamics Stage Red leader:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/REGdYGVoKTk?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The people who work with Trump on his policies have no idea of his level of cognitive development. They assume he is a stage Orange CEO type (like many of them are). But he's far less developed. This is only shocking if you've never studied developmental psychology.</p>
<p>It was obvious before his election that this would be Trump's leadership style.</p>
<p>The problem with a selfish leader is that eventually most of his followers and supports get so hurt and disgusted by his selfishness that they turn on him and start a mutiny out of a need to protect themselves. This is proper, as it is the karma which selfishness creates. There cannot be an extremely selfish general on the battlefield, for example, because eventually even his most loyal troops will be forced to turn on him, because his selfishness will threaten their survival agenda.</p>
<p>A leader who is more selfish than his followers cannot last. Sooner or later they will eat him alive. Just like there is a problem with leading from too high on the Spiral, there is a problem with leading from too low on the Spiral. Successful leadership requires that the leader be one or two levels above his followers. Otherwise things become unsustainable. Trump is less cognitively, morally, and spiritually developed than most of his cabinet. If this happened on a ship, they'd throw the captain overboard.</p>
<p>The funny thing about selfishness is, people are too selfish to tolerate a selfish leader for long. Sharks eat their own kind. A leader needs to be someone a follower can look up to and aspire to be like. Otherwise, why follow him? Who wants to follow someone who is less developed than they are? Such situations breed resentment and discontent since they are fundamentally backwards. The more capable resent having to follow the less capable. The more moral resent having to follow the less moral.</p>

<title>I Always Look Orange</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/i-always-look-orange</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The Trump admin is <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/459884-trump-administration-rolls-back-obama-era-lightbulb-rules" target="_blank">rolling back new Obama-era light bulb efficiency standards</a>, which is sad enough by itself, but Trump's justification for it is just such a classic example of egotism:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Number one, to me, most importantly, the light's no good. I always look orange. And so do you."</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_iFi1qH8Cg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>It's little gems like this that tie a bow on all our work about ego and self-bias.</p>
<p>FYI, <a href="https://amzn.to/33jgb0H" target="_blank">CFL bulbs</a> are very toxic when shattered (don't buy those), but the <a href="https://amzn.to/34uhGcM" target="_blank">new LED bulbs</a> are not toxic and they produce high quality light at any color temperature you want. Personally, I upgraded all the incandescent bulbs in my apartment to LED bulbs 3 years ago and have been very happy with them. The new LED bulbs have a great quality of light and they last for 5-10 years! I have not replaced a light bulb in 3 years. It's so convenient. It's a revolution in lighting. If you haven't upgraded to LED, you're missing out. They are 5x more energy-efficient than incandescent bulbs, produce zero heat, and only only cost about $3-$10 each. Every building in the world should be using LEDs. I like the 2700K color temperature best. It gives off a warm homey yellow glow, almost the same as the classic incandescent bulbs. Or if you prefer white light, go for the 5000K color temp. There's no need to buy incandescents ever again.</p>

<title>Chemical Corruption</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/chemical-corruption</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>An eye-opening look into how corrupt chemical companies can be:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsoqJFQT3Kk?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>BTW, if you cook your food on those black, cheap, Teflon non-stick frying pans, I recommended ditching all of them and buying yourself a set of high quality stainless steel pans without any kind of chemical coatings. For example, Telfon is so poisonous to birds that if you roast some nuts to feed your pet parrot, the parrot will die from eating them. Now imagine what those kinds of chemicals are doing to your body and brain.</p>
<p>If the future I will release some videos about how to detox heavy metals and chemicals from your body and brain. This is actually a crucial elements of improving your life. If your brain is filled with toxic chemicals like mercury, lead, arsenic, and others like Telfon, you will not be able to self-actualize properly. This can seriously affect your health and mental function, including your ability to meditate, concentrate, and do consciousness work.</p>
<p>Chemical toxicity is the leading cause of things like auto-immune diseases, thyroid diseases, cancers, ADD, autism, crime, and overall societal dysfunction. Most people have no idea how bad it is. You could be suffering from it and have no idea. The good news is, there exist effective methods for detoxing this stuff and healing yourself.</p>
<p>These days you have to be very careful about what you put in your body and keep in your household. You never know when you're consuming something filled with toxic chemicals. It could be your make up, shampoo, soap, mouthwash, toothpaste, paper towels, drinking water, coffee, tea, food packaging, laundry detergent, carpet, dental fillings, etc. So watch out. Educate yourself and be a mindful shopper. If you have kids, be careful what you feed and wash them with. Toxic chemicals in their brain will affect their ability to do well in do well in school, socialize, and self-actualize.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: clean up your household and pay a bit extra for more natural products which contain less chemicals. The cheaper things are, the more toxic chemicals they usually contain.</p>

<title>Profound Quotes #016</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/profound-quotes-016</link>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>"An aimless life is always a troubled life. Every individual should have an aim. But do not forget that the quality of your aim will depend the quality of your life. Your aim should be high and wide, generous and disinterested; this will make your life precious to yourself and to others. Whatever your ideal, it cannot be perfectly realized unless you have realized perfection in yourself."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- Sri Aurobindo</p>

<title>Internal Workings Of CNN</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/internal-workings-of-cnn</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the media, here's an illuminating look into the inner workings of CNN:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJASlSNRxv8?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I think Jeff Zucker is an intelligent and decent guy, but he does not understand the depth of the problem of what "reporting the truth" means. Truth is much more tricky than merely fact-checking some wrong information, because who gets to say what counts as valid fact-checking? You can't just assume that "facts" exist! What if "facts" are really how your mind constructs reality? Who's construction should we trust? Yours? Mine? Jeff Zucker's? A billionaire's? An atheist's? A Muslim's? A Christian's? A Buddhist's? A scientist's? A white person's? A black person's? etc. What if each person has their own "facts"? What do you do then?</p>
<p>I'd like you to notice that everything talked about in the above video is really an issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology" target="_blank">epistemology</a> (human knowledge). The question of "What is true?" is an epistemic question. Notice that this question is not merely philosophical, it has serious real-world consequences. How do you maintain a high quality society when people cannot agree with each other's perspectives on truth, or when some segments of society have really warped versions of truth? How do we deal with that as a society? How does CNN deal with it? How does Facebook deal with it? How does Google deal with it? How do you deal with it? How do your parents deal with it? What if the majority of the population believe in falsehood? How do you go about correcting that when they believe it's a fact?</p>
<p>Notice how challenging and deep this issue is. This is not merely a Trump problem. Epistemology has been a root problem for mankind since the dawn of civilization. We are always arguing about what is true, what is reasonable, what is biased, what is opinion, what is fact, and what is the proper interpretation of things. Have you wondered about why this is? What causes this? You'd think that if reality was an objective fact, we'd all agree on it by now. You'd think that if reality was an objective fact it would be impossible to mislead people about it. Yet human history shows the opposite. Masses of people are mislead all the time. How can this be? And can you be sure you aren't one of those who's misled? After all, if people are easy to mislead, you are person, therefore you must be easy to mislead.</p>
<p>Notice that before one can answer the question of the proper way to act, or make any proper plans, one must first answer the question of What is true? If your perspective of reality is so distorted that you see the world upside-down, your plans and actions will also be upside-down, doubling down on the problem. The solution to any serious problem is, first and foremost, to see the problem with undistorted perception. In many cases taking that first step is enough to resolve the problem. But most people want to jump straight into action, ignoring the first step by dismissing it as "mere philosophy" or "theory". But what good is pressing the accelerator pedal when you haven't first figured out which direction is True North? Undistorted perception is NOT "just theory".</p>
<p>Life's most important problems can only be solved by a shift in perspective & understanding. In such cases, there's something deep you're not conscious of about the problem which makes it manifest over and over again, and it will not stop until you see through to the root of it by properly using your mind.</p>
<p>Most problems are the result of the improper use of one's mind. Think about that.</p>
<p>People who casually blame CNN, The New York Times, "main stream media", "Jewish media", Hollywood elites, Silicon Valley, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and yes, even Fox News, do not understand the depth of the epistemic problem. The problem of disseminating "truth" is the most challenging problem that mankind has ever faced. We still haven't figured out how to do in over 10,000 years of trying. Schools, universities, parents, government, the media, science, religion, and every spiritual school all face this fundamental problem. Devils will ALWAYS corrupt the purest sources of truth because falsehood is necessary for survival. Not understanding this triples the problem.</p>
<p>When you understand the depth of what I'm saying here you will realize that epistemology is the most important topic that mankind can study, research, or teach. Yet precisely because this is so, it is not studied or taught almost at all. Devils are not interested in epistemology. It doesn't suite their schemes. So our problem then becomes: how do you teach 7 billion devils proper epistemology when their lives hinge on them not learning it? This problem is more challenging and more important to solve than the problem of building a colony on Mars. Yet it gets no attention and no funding.</p>

<p>This is conscious politics in the flesh!</p>
<p>He has the strongest, most conscious, most loving vision for the next stage of America's evolution and he has the experience and balls to actualize it. Don't take such a rare leader for granted. After he's gone, there won't be another like him for a generation. He is a leader 40 years ahead of his time. Within 50 years, all of his plans will become the taken-for-granted norm regardless of whether he wins the Presidency or not.</p>

<title>Infinite Life</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/infinite-life</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Check out this wonderful YT channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbnbBWJtwsf0jLGUwX5Q3g/" target="_blank">Journey To The Microcosmos</a>. They feature videos on microscopic life. Notice the complexity and intelligence of even microscopic organisms.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmoL8LlQwWQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kux1j1ccsgg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There's more:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZoaKzEXzi8" target="_blank">Stentors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3PLUeD_JAg" target="_blank">Rotifers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Try to imagine how unaware of the larger cosmos these little lifeforms are. Now imagine that you as a human are as unaware of a higher reality as these little guys are of human reality. This gives you a proper sense of how limited your consciousness is and how much more you have to become conscious of.</p>
<p>Your body is a super-organism composed of billions of tiny individuated organisms all working together perfectly to create the larger unity that is the human you. Yet none of those organisms are aware of the larger unity they create. Likewise, humans have no idea of the larger unity they create. And so it goes to infinity. Such is the intelligence of God's design. The intelligence of it is infinite.</p>
<p>Consciousness is alive at all scales, from infinitely small to infinitely large. In fact there is no such thing as small and large because the scale extends infinitely far in all directions and all dimensions. There is no difference in scale between a human, a moss piglet, and the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p>You are not truly awake until you are conscious of how intelligent consciousness is at all scales — of how every scale dovetails perfectly into higher and higher unities which extend upward to infinity. This is the body/mind of God, dreaming an infinite number of dreams and interweaving them together seamlessly into one Grand Unity. A cradle for infinite life. A fractal of all possible lifeforms, branching out forever — your human self is one tip of one branch.</p>

<title>What Is Fascism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/what-is-fascism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a good intro to the psychology of fascism which most people do not understand:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IMpFcUXq2_w?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The funny thing about fascism is, fascism can only flourish when people are ignorant about what fascism is and therefore blind to their own participation in it.</p>
<p>In other words, a fascist does not understand he's a fascist. A fascist thinks he's a patriot. Unfortunately this stuff is not taught well in schools. Schools do not teach our citizens how easy it is to get sucked into fascist ideology, instead it demonizes Nazis, which makes people complacent.</p>

<title>What Is Neo-Liberalism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/what-is-neo-liberalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A great introductory video:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myH3gg5o0t0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There is also:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkBpqLWFNg4" target="_blank">Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgwVz0D6rI" target="_blank">Part 3</a> (not as good as parts 1 & 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most tricky ideologies are those which aren't seen as ideologies at all. How can you begin to let go of a thing you're not even aware you're holding?</p>
<p>It's not that Neo-Liberalism is bad per se, it's that it is starting to show its limits and must evolve into some higher, better system. Every system must evolve to accommodate higher consciousness and love, or die. And actually, death is nothing other than evolution. The next 100 years for America and much of the developed world will be about finding the next evolutionary step beyond Neo-Liberalism. What that is we don't exactly know. It won't just be old-school socialism. It will be something else. Perhaps a strange hybrid system. Like all technological advances, we'll have to find it through trail and error. That trail and error will manifest as social turbulence, which we've been seeing more and more of lately. As 3rd world countries start to reach parity with the 1st world countries, as the world becomes more global and equalized, there will be a lot of turbulence because old systems will have to dissolve while millions of people cling to them.</p>
<p>We are like a snake just beginning to shed its skin.</p>
<p>But fear not! This world circumstance also presents many exciting opportunities. What will be your role in helping mankind evolve into the 21st century? Contemplate that. Don't just be a passive leaf blown by the wind. Decide to be an active participant in this process of evolution. Decide what role you want to play, or someone else will decide it for you. Also decide to be on the right side of history, which is always the side which seeks to expand consciousness and love to more living beings.</p>
<p>In this sense your job in life is very simple: to decide in which specific ways you want to manifest your love.</p>

<p>This is one of the world's greatest scientists, yet he's clueless about metaphysics and spirituality.</p>
<p>Here Chomsky is basically parroting the standard paradigm of scientific materialism / realism, which fundamentally misunderstands why religion exists.</p>
<p>The source of religion is NOT wishful thinking nor superstition, as many scientists believe. The irony is that holding such a view is deeply unscientific. Such a belief can only be held by people who have never engaged in serious spiritual practice or metaphysical inquiry.</p>
<p>Ignorance like this is unfortunately common among some of our greatest scientists. And that is because they do not make a serious study of epistemology, metaphysics, or spirituality. And the reason they don't is because their belief that spirituality is bullshit is an example of confirmation bias. If you believe that spirituality is bullshit, you will never do the spiritual practice required to discover that it's not bullshit. So from your POV it will always appear as though there is no evidence that spirituality isn't bullshit. Because your fundamental premise — that reality must be material and non-mystical — is wrong. Yet you are not openminded or intellectually curious enough to question it.</p>
<p>All of that is just an example of terrible epistemology and sloppy science. If you are a serious scientist you understand that you cannot pre-judge the results of an experiment before running it. But why then do you pre-judge spirituality and metaphysics before practicing it? Can you see your own hypocrisy here? This is no different than refusing to look into a telescope to see if Jupiter is a real planet because you have already decided that Jupiter isn't real, therefore it would be a waste of time to look. It's viciously circular logic. This vicious circularity isn't just a bug, it's feature. Such circularity is necessary to create a paradigm lock, which is necessary to construct a worldview, which is ultimately necessary for your mind to construct "reality". There is no "reality" without circular logic. Circular logic is how you construct the "physical world"! Ta-da!</p>

<title>Strange-Loopy Rollercoasters</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/strange-loopy-rollercoasters</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a fun example of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">strange loops</a> from the Rollercoaster Tycoon game:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbjqWThzXME?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>See, I told you this stuff has real-world consequences.</p>
<p>Strange loops are fundamental to the structure of reality.</p>
<p>If you're gonna be doing lots of psychedelics, you better have a solid theoretical understanding of what strange loops are because your mind will encounter some hairy ones and they will mindfuck you.</p>
<p>So when one day you realize that you crawled out of your own vagina — remember, I told you so ;)</p>

<title>Projection Projecting Projection</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/projection-projecting-projection</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The trickeries of the mind never cease to amaze. Case in point, this article by David Kupelian:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wnd.com/2019/01/democrats-and-the-dark-art-of-projection/" target="_blank">Democrats And The Dark Art Of Projection</a></p>
<p>Which is a master class in how to project one's own projections onto others by accusing them of projection! The boldness of it is impressive.</p>
<p>In this article a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">stage Blue</a> worldview is projecting it's limited cognitive, moral, and spiritual development onto a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">stage Green</a> worldview, thereby seeing Green as lower than Blue — which is precisely backwards. Green appears to be lower than Blue when seen from Blue's limited POV. But since Blue doesn't acknowledge that POVs are relative, Blue isn't aware of itself as a POV, thereby confusing itself with truth. A big part of what it means to be at stage Blue is that you cannot see your POV as just one POV among many others. If you were conscious of that, you'd grow out of Blue.</p>
<p>Notice that the reason this can happen is precisely because all points of view are relative, so there is no baseline to ground any point of view. So if you imagine that your opponents are projecting, they are! — according to your projection, which you imagine you are not doing. If you imagine you aren't projecting, that's enough to make it seem like you're not projecting. But of course all points of view are imaginary to begin with. Which is precisely what projection is trying to deny: "No, I'm not making stuff up, I'm just stating the truth while you're making stuff up!" << Yeah, that's something you're making up! "No I'm not! You are!" << You made that up too!</p>
<p>The #1 rule of projection is: the more you project, the more you accuse others of projecting, the more you deny your own projections.</p>
<p>To be really effective at projection you must attack the person you're projecting upon for projecting onto you before they've even made that accusation. By accusing them first, you deny them the ability to call you out for your projection. This is classic, classic gas-lighting.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you're cheating on your spouse, you must accuse your spouse of cheating on you before he/she accuses you. This makes it much harder for him/her to accuse you, even though you're the one who's cheating. You'd think that the cheater wouldn't be so obnoxious as to accuse the person he's cheating on of cheating on him (only a shameless asshole would do that), but its precisely because you think he wouldn't do it that he does do it! Because he can use your expectations of decency to cloak the truth from you. That's devilry 101. Devilry is all about finding bold ways of presenting falsehood as truth and truth as falsehood.</p>
<p>Projection is one of the trickiest mechanisms of self-deception. A <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics stage Blue</a> mind especially tends not to notice its own projections.</p>
<p>Do liberals engage in projection? Of course. Most people do. But conservatives engage in it far more. And conservatives are much more likely to deny that they are projecting. Part of what it means to be more cognitively and spiritually developed on the Spiral is that higher stages are more aware when they are projecting while lower stages are totally in denial about it. It takes a lot of consciousness work to escape projection entirely. 99.9% of people cannot escape projection because they simply haven't done enough serious self-reflection. Transcending projection requires a profound understanding of how <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/self-bias" target="_blank">Self-Bias</a> works, which again, most people are in denial about.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about projection in a future video since it's such an important topic.</p>

<title>This Work Is Not About Belief</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/this-work-is-not-about-belief</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>All of my teachings are worthless unless you validate them in your direct experience. This stuff is far too profound to be heard or believed. Belief in what I say is a great obstacle to this work. You will spend years believing me only to realize that you made a big mistake. Yet at the same time, actively disbelieving me — trying to debunk me or debate me — is an even greater mistake. The correct method is to listen to what I say, consider it as an advanced possibility, and do the work to validate this possibility and feel it as your living reality. This work is about transforming your experience of reality.</p>
<p>I have no desire to make you believe in God or my teachings. What you believe is such a shallow level that it is irrelevant as far as this work goes. What matters is what you're conscious of, what state of consciousness you're in, and what the meta, cognitive structures of your mind are. This work is not about the contents of your mind. This work is structural. Think of this difference as the difference between apps vs the OS or BIOS on a computer. In our work here, we're not interested in changing the apps of the human mind, we're interested in changing the OS & even the BIOS. This work is meta work. This work is experiential. This work is about changing what reality is for you. You don't even know what that means yet. It will take you years of work just to appreciate what was just said. And that's as it must be. You can't know what you're missing until years of trial and error.</p>
<p>It would speed things along greatly for you to realize that we are not interested in getting you to believe things here. Anything you believe is far too shallow to help you. Belief is like a veil of fakery which obscures the doing of the real work. So be careful not to get tricked into thinking you are doing the work when you are merely rearranging your beliefs. The real work requires hours upon hours of precise mindfulness and accurate self-observation. Precision and accuracy in this work is important.</p>
<p>Towards this end it would help you greatly to distinguish between what is a belief, and what is not. Spend some time observing in your direct experience what is a belief, and what is not. Get really clear about this without getting caught up in the trap of judging whether a belief is true or false. What's more important than whether a belief is true or false is that you are conscious that it is a belief regardless. For example, "The Earth is round" is a belief regardless of whether its "true". Just because a belief is "true" does not mean it isn't problematic or doesn't distort your experience of reality. In this sense, scientific beliefs can be more problematic than religious ones because scientific beliefs are not usually acknowledged to be beliefs, or problematic — yet they are both.</p>
<p>Notice the distinct difference between believing a thing and direct experience. Notice that experience does not care what you believe. Although of course your beliefs greatly distort and color your experience.</p>
<p>And even though I call all this "work", you must find a way to do it so that you enjoy the process, rather than making it some chore that you must do. You will never be successful in this work as long as it feels like a chore. You must find a way to connect it with your passion for life. It must become an organic part of your life.</p>

<p>People often associate Love with happiness and sweetness. But they overlook the brutality of real Love.</p>
<p>You are never going to understand Love at an existential level until you confront Love at is rawest form, as shown above. Don't mistake Love for something that pleases your ego.</p>

<title>Stage Orange Corrupting Video Games</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/stage-orange-corrupting-video-games</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you're an avid gamer you've probably noticed the corruption which has infected the video game industry over the last 10 years: micro-transactions, loot boxes, gambling, season passes, games-as-service, bullshit limited editions, pre-mature bug-ridden releases, and other scammy tactics. Well, that's the epitome of stage Orange.</p>
<p>Here's but one perfect example:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-BuUqsd71w?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As a gamer, make a distinction between Stage Orange vs Stage Green games. Stage Green games are more about heart and artistry than profits and milking gamers.</p>
<p>I love this example because it shows you how down-to-Earth and relevant Spiral Dynamics is.</p>

<title>Psilocybin &amp; Personality Change</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/psilocybin-and-personality-change</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I found this video insightful. According to this research, psychedelics are one of the only and the most powerful tools for personality change.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kSoka5iSi4?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course this is not limited to psilocybin. All psychedelics lead to personality change. Especially the most powerful ones like 5-MeO-DMT, DPT, and N,N-DMT.</p>
<p>If you want serious personality change what you need is to not just a psychedelic trip, but specifically you need a psychedelic breakthrough. A breakthrough is not an ordinary trip. A breakthrough means that life as you knew it is over. You have gone beyond human life, beyond physical reality, beyond science, beyond religion, beyond memory, beyond language, beyond all teachings, beyond your birth. You have entered the realm of the impossible & the insane. Your entire paradigm of reality has been shattered to the point where you cannot even remember what the old paradigm was. You have escaped the labyrinth of your own mind. You have broken reality. You have left The Matrix. It is the most significant event in your life.</p>
<p>Don't worry, you'll know it once you're there.</p>

<title>Liberia: Land Of True Freedom</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/liberia-land-of-true-freedom</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A forum member (Ero) shared this video on our forum and I thought it was important share it with you all.</p>
<p>Most people today simply have no appreciation of what survival is like without a decent government. The following is what you get without government, courts, laws, police, regulations, infrastructure, roads, sewers, education, public health care, welfare, etc. This is the true "free market". This is what real freedom looks like. But are you sure you want it?:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRuSS0iiFyo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Only when you appreciate the above do you understand why government is so crucial. And you see why consciousness cannot be raised en mass without high quality government & infrastructure. This romantic idea that you can just go be a monk somewhere in a cave is a childish fantasy. Reality is far more complex than that. Living in caves doesn't scale across thousands of people. If even only 1% of the population decided to live as monks in caves, there would be such a cave shortage that monks would be killing each other in the night to secure their caves such that the piles of corpses and garbage would rise so high as to block the sun.</p>
<p>The above is Spiral Dynamics stage Purple & Red at its unhealthiest.</p>

<title>Introducing Slavoj Zizek</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/introducing-slavoj-zizek</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I disagree with him on some fundamental points — he certainly doesn't understand nonduality, Buddhism, Love, or Spiral Dynamics — but he's an interesting and complex thinker that offers some serious good food for thought on political issues and collective human nature.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2O6f2R9PZI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>He's the entertaining and intellectually-stimulating kind of neurotic ;) You can find a bunch of his videos on YouTube just by searching his name. He makes some very good structural critiques of capitalism. He has a pretty good grasp of the devilry behind ideology. By studying his videos you can deepen your understanding of ideology. Which is a topic I talk about all the time, even if I don't always call it that.</p>
<p>I admire the authenticity of his neuroticism.</p>

<title>The Amazing Cornel West</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-amazing-cornel-west</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Cornel West is fucking amazing! One of the greatest orators of our time. Spiritually advanced too. He gives Christianity and academia a good name.</p>

<p>Notice his understanding of love and his expanded circle of concern. This is a marker of high moral development: a love that extends to all beings. An abundant generosity which does not demonize others.</p>
<p>Notice also his boldness. He is not "neutral" to both sides. He calls devilry out by its name. Because true love is a radical thing. It rattles the status quo. It speaks truth to power.</p>
<p>If Jesus was alive today, his politics would probably look like those of Cornel West.</p>

<title>The War On Government</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-war-on-government</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Sadly it's trendy today for young people to feel like government does nothing for them. This kind of nihilistic, cynical apathy is deeply problematic because it plays right into the hands of those who rig the system.</p>

<title>Trust The Force</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/trust-the-force</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>At some point in your spiritual journey you will reach a point where you must switch off your targeting computer — let go and trust your highest wisdom and intuition.</p>
<p>This scene captures it perfectly. George Lucas had an amazing ability to convey spiritual concepts:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR7CeC-rqiE?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>That is what you must do to master life.</p>
<p>This can be scary for many rationalists, materialists, and skeptics to do because in their paradigm a thing isn't real unless it is "hard" quantifiable. Anything short of that is dismissed as wishful thinking, "faith", sentimentality, or pseudoscience. The only problem with that is, Truth and Consciousness are infinite, so they are not quantifiable. To quantify it would be to limit it. To make it "hard" would be to weaken it. This is what a lot of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Stage Orange</a> conventional thinkers don't understand. The deepest aspects of life are not quantifiable in principle. Why would you assume they could be?</p>

<title>Health Insurance Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/health-insurance-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In this video a former health insurance executive admits to being a devil, falsifying the debate on universal healthcare to maximize profits. Now he has seen the light and is working to redeem himself:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djD-OeIJ2G4?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A devil who realizes his devilry becomes a vehicle for Love. Devilry ends through consciousness, and no other way, because devilry is nothing but lack of consciousness. To defeat darkness all you must do is turn on the lights.</p>
<p>What you must understand about corporate executives is that they — like all devils — do not understand that they are devils. They are unconscious survival machines.</p>

<title>The Wise Patriot, Round Two</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-wise-patriot-round-two</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I love this guy's down to Earth political analysis:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUxQY0xHEFY?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is a grounded example of stage Green politics. Stage Green is not all crazy college feminist protestors as you sometimes see portrayed by right-wing YouTube or Jordan Peterson and his ilk.</p>
<p>There are serious, practical, reasonable, and masculine stage Green thinkers. As you would expect, since healthy stage Green doesn't negate stage Orange but transcends AND includes it. Healthy Green is built on a foundation of healthy Orange. What Green adds to Orange is empathy & a recognition of the importance of collective issues. While Orange believes all problems in society can be resolved through individualism and personal success, Green understands that this is necessary but insufficient. Collective responsibility is just as important. Green contrasts sharply with Blue in that it is able to appreciate the value of diversity & multiculturalism in a way that Blue is totally blind to. Green can look through the eyes of different cultures while Blue cannot. Green's masculinity is also more grounded, more comfortable with the feminine, whereas stage Blue & Orange masculinity tends to be a juvenile bravado which struggles to appreciate the feminine beyond child rearing and personal sexual gratification.</p>

<title>Life In Venezuela</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/life-in-venezuela</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>An eye-opening look into Venezuela's largest slum by an independent Youtuber:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jN5LZR4ejkg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYVkFcWqcIo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Note: Venezuela is not an example of the evils of socialism. It's an example of a grossly underdeveloped country. This is a distinction folks commonly fail to make. Socialism cannot work in an underdeveloped country because survival needs are simply too pressing so selfishness and corruption run rampant. Stage Red/Blue countries are not developed enough to sustain socialist ideals. Which is why socialism failed in places like the Soviet Union and North Korea but aspects of it have succeeded in Northern Europe. A totalitarian state which adopts a socialist veneer is still structurally a totalitarian state. The content of the ideology is irrelevant because what runs the show is the structure, which in this case is totalitarian. The reason aspects of socialism have succeeded in Northern Europe is because those states evolved way beyond totalitarianism before they started toying around with socialism.</p>
<p>Not that I consider myself a socialist. Just pointing out a common mistake I see in politics. People routinely misunderstand the causes of Venezuela's situation. Their problem is developmental and infrastructural, not ideological. Corruption is a massive problem which has choked up their entire system.</p>
<p>It's the same problem as a criminal trying to act like a spiritual man of God. It doesn't work because it's just a veneer. Structurally he's still a selfish, egotistical criminal. No amount godly language or godly ideals will change that. To embody spirituality he'd have to first outgrow his criminality. Likewise, adopting a socialist ideology in a totalitarian state only serves as an Orwellian disguise. In theory the state is for the people, but in practice it's every man for himself, looting as much wealth under the table as possible while maintaining the facade of selflessness.</p>
<p>So the lesson of the 20th century is not that socialism is evil but that socialism should not be adopted by underdeveloped countries at Stage Blue or below because they cannot sustain it. Socialism would only be possible at Stage Green or above. But even then, I still have critiques of socialism and I don't support its blanket adoption. Aspects of it need to be cherrypicked and hybridized with capitalism.</p>
<p>We see in China that socialism has also not been sustainable because China has not yet evolved past Stage Orange capitalism. So even though China puts on a veneer of socialism, structurally it's very capitalistic and also totalitarian because it cannot help itself. You can't shortcut structural development with a flowery ideology. If only it were so easy. Moralistic ideology is not growth! It's a fake front designed to say that no growth is necessary because it has already been actualized. It's the same problem as saying that you are a devout follower of God, yet you have never actually become conscious of what God is. Talking about God without first being conscious of God is idol worship. It will not make you godly because the structure of your consciousness is still dualistic.</p>

<title>The Most Corrupt Countries In The World</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's some really interesting research on corruption:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017" target="_blank">Corruption World Map</a></p>
<p>Corruption is basically a measure of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/collective-ego" target="_blank">Collective Ego</a>, or the consciousness level and the developmental level of a country. The less conscious a group of people are, the more corrupt their country is.</p>
<p>If you want to quantify which countries are the most evolved, don't measure their GDP, measure their corruption index. If you want to know whether a country is advancing forward or regressing backward, look to see if their corruption index is improving decade after decade.</p>
<p>You want to live in a country which has the least corruption. Unless you're a corrupt devil, in which case you want to exploit that corruption to benefit your survival.</p>
<p>A quick way to gauge whether a specific policy proposal is high consciousness or low consciousness is to ask the question: Does this reduce or increase corruption? You'd be amazed by how many laws, bills, and proposals actually increase corruption! This is by design. Corruption can't help but to spread itself.</p>
<p>If the corruption index of your country is below 50, then you're in a sketchy part of the world and development will be harder for you. Not impossible, just harder. Countries below 50 will have a lot of Spiral Dynamics <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Stage Blue</a> and countries below 40 will have a lot of Stage Red & Purple. Don't create a victim mentality about it. Do the best you can with the cards you've been dealt. And if you were born in a country with a corruption index above 50, consider yourself very lucky. You don't even understand how bad life can get. You have been totally spoiled. Be grateful and use this gift to make something of your life and uplift the world. Countries below 50 badly need help from the countries above 50. Be careful not to demonize countries below 50. They need your help, not your scorn.</p>

<title>A Taste Of Infinity</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/a-taste-of-infinity</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a small look into the mind of God:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXTpASSd9xE?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Contemplate: How is it possible to zoom into a thing forever? What does this mean about the nature of reality?</p>
<p>Just the fact that this fractal exists should already clue you in that consciousness must be infinite. Otherwise how could you be conscious of it? If an infinite object was loaded into a finite mind, the mind would crash. Hence the mind itself must be infinite.</p>
<p>Consider this: In a finite reality it would be impossible to count up from 1 to infinity. This is only possible because consciousness is actually infinite.</p>
<p>But how can the human mind be infinite? Because the human mind is a virtual machine running inside the infinite mind of God. God's mind is running an infinite number of virtual machines, all which are themselves infinite. That's what Georg Cantor called the Absolute Infinite set. It is the super-set of all possible sets. The mindblowing nature of infinity is that you can divide it into an infinite number of parts, and each of those parts will be its own infinity. Infinity within infinity within infinity — to infinity! In other words, infinity literally allows you to create something from nothing, because infinity is endless and bottomless.</p>
<p>Consider this: If you have an infinite number of apples in a basket, you can pull out one apple, eat it, and you will still have an infinite number of apples left. You just created an apple from nothing! Ta-da! This is how God creates the universe. Its mind is not bound by any physical limitation or lack. It cannot lack anything because it is an unlimited fount of creativity. All it has to do to create a thing is subdivide itself. But it can subdivide itself infinitely many times, so it never loses anything in the process of creation. Even after God subdivides itself an infinite number of times to create all human minds, it still remains an infinite Unity. The Absolute Unity of all possible divisions. Absolute Unity turns out to be identical to division. Going full-circle.</p>

<title>How Nazis Win Elections</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/how-nazis-win-elections</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you're a student of history you've probably wondered, "How in the hell did Hitler get democratically elected? It doesn't make sense that people would willing support a guy like that."</p>
<p>Well, this is how:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qvB5tHRNOI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Trumpism is a case study in demagoguery, collective self-deception, group think, cult psychology, ideology, egotism, devilry, ignorance, unconsciousness, selfishness, division, projection, scapegoating, demonization, judgment, denial, self-bias, confirmation bias, corruption, xenophobia, racism, and fear.</p>
<p>All the epistemic stuff we cover in-depth on Actualized.org all comes together in the real world like this.</p>
<p>A toxic brew of the most pathological aspects of Spiral Dynamics stage Red, Blue, and Orange.</p>
<p>You might wonder, But why do people eat it up? Because they are at those same levels of development/consciousness themselves. Birds of a feather flock together. Your politics directly correlates with your values, which correlates with your stage of ego development. You can only vote for a leader as high as your vision can see. So egotistical, ethnocentric people gladly vote for egotistical, ethnocentric leaders, especially when the leader pushes their fear buttons.</p>
<p>Watch out, the 2020 election is going to get very nasty. Trump's demagoguery will hit an all time high as his ego gets cornered by his own manipulations. One of the hallmarks of a giant ego is that it refuses to yield or admit wrong-doing or defeat. When Trump loses, he will have to deny it to himself and his supporters somehow. And there begins the heavy-duty devilry. There will likely be blood.</p>
<p>This is what happens when a dense ego is put into a position of power. It's not an issue of left vs right, the issue is density of ego.</p>

<title>The Highest Purpose</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-highest-purpose</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Pasting this from my personal journal:</p>
<p>My highest purpose is to lead people to Infinite Consciousness, Infinite Love, Infinite Selflessness, and Infinite Understanding. I am to show people what the highest form of leadership looks like. My entire life is dedicated to this cause. I am to lead people to the realization of Infinite Love and Infinite Beauty by embodiment and demonstration of Infinite Love in my own life. I am a vehicle for God's highest Love for mankind. The function of my human existence is to demonstrate the Goodness and Magnitude of God to those who lack the vision to see it. I am to use the gift of my extraordinary human mind to communicate God's highest intentions. I am not to hold back my love out of fear or selfish need. I am to be fearless and selfless and endure any consequences and suffering which will arise from such a path. The endurance of these obstacles and pain is part of my purification process. The suffering I endure will only make me more loving and understanding of the suffering of others, who are none other than myself. I am to shed all ill-will, malice, and judgment towards others, for I cannot help but see them as myself. In the end, the love and selflessness I radiate will inspire and transform the world. My reward will be the love I radiate and Infinite Understanding of the universe. My understanding will reach superhuman levels beyond all human comprehension or and strain the human self to contain. There is no doubt that this my way. I will have many critics and naysayers, but none of them will deter me because all of them I will be overcome simply by radiating more love because I understand that their ignorance is their limited way of showing their love. I understand that all hatred, judgment, and violence is just a condensed form of love. Through total self-understanding I will become incapable of seeing wrong or evil, even in those who seek to harm me. By the end of my human life the highest potential of a human life will have been actualized. The details of how all of this unfolds will be unimportant, as it will simply unfold as it must. My body and mind is at the highest service of Universal Intelligence. The point of no return has already been reached so no further decision is necessary. All of this is self-evidently true. When I lose track of my highest purpose (and I will) I am to return here and re-read this statement, re-grounding myself in that which is undeniable.</p>
<p>Actualized 2.0 is coming. Brace yourself for a sledgehammer of Love.</p>

<title>The 9 Stages Of Ego Development</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-9-stages-of-ego-development</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This 97-page research paper by Susanne Cook-Greuter is one of the most important things you can read if you want to understand human development:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cook-greuter.com/Cook-Greuter%209%20levels%20paper%20new%201.1'14%2097p%5B1%5D.pdf" target="_blank">Nine Levels Of Increasing Embrace In Ego Development</a></p>
<p>I recommend you download it, print it out, and read it methodically with a highlighter. It's filled with insights and wisdom you won't find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cook-greuter.com/" target="_blank">Cook-Greuter</a> is a Harvard educated yet independent developmental psychologist. So this research has some scientific weight behind it, based on empirical research.</p>
<p>This will take your understanding of developmental psychology & Spiral Dynamics to the next level.</p>
<p>It also dovetails with my discussion of Conscious Politics, since the quality of one's politics directly depends on the development of one's ego.</p>
<p>We will be talking a lot more about developmental psychology in the future. So this is required reading for that. Spiral Dynamics is only one part of the larger field of developmental psychology.</p>

<title>How Government Really Works</title>

<p>Russia is a Spiral Dynamics Stage Red government. It's government by mafia rule. Be careful not to judge it too much because your government had to go through this stage of development before it evolved higher. You don't get a high functioning democracy without a lot of theft, beatings, torture, slit throats, bullets to the head, and rape.</p>

<title>4000 Exo-Planets Found</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/4000-exo-planets-found</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The first extra-solar planet was discovered in 1992. Up to now 4000 have been discovered.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aiFD_LBx2nM?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There are approximately 250 billion stars in 1 galaxy.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2 trillion galaxies in our universe.</p>
<p>If there are an average of 3 planets per star, that means there are 1,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets in our universe.</p>
<p>But all of that is just but an infinitesimally small speck of dust within Infinite Consciousness. All those planets are as far away from infinity as the number 3.</p>
<p>It takes Infinite Consciousness less than a nanosecond to dream all that up.</p>
<p>It has no beginning or end. It goes on forever. It is unlimited.</p>
<p>Imagine holding all of that form within your consciousness.</p>
<p>Try to comprehend that. That is the mind of God.</p>

<title>Vice's Liberal vs Conservative Panels</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/vices-liberal-vs-conservative-panels</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Vice has some excellent discussion panels featuring diverse political and cultural perspectives.</p>
<p>The panels struck me as highly valuable because they require you to open your mind to alternative POVs. As you watch, pay extra attention to how you get triggered and how you judge these people. This is not about determining who's right or wrong but about going meta to see the relativity of all perspectives. Relativity is what explains why these folks see the world so differently. It's not that ones are right and others are wrong, but that each ego-mind sees the world according to its survival needs and whatever ideologies it was programmed with during its development.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMvih_KEMWo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>That's just a taste, there's much more and I recommend you watch them all:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVIoC5ROaHk" target="_blank">Black Conservatives Debate Black Liberals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utW1ItcMeJw" target="_blank">LGBTQ+ Conservatives Debate Liberals - Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safLwed9SSo" target="_blank">LGBTQ+ Conservatives Debate Liberals - Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9I6b1JEb2k" target="_blank">Latino Conservatives Debate Liberals - Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyymEC8FQHU" target="_blank">Latino Conservatives Debate Liberals - Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Really, really, really pay attention to how you judge POVs which are not your own. Also notice how you judge people purely based on their race, gender, clothing, religion, and style of speaking. The point is to notice that you are extremely judgmental and dismissive of any worldview which is not aligned with your own. Notice that alternative POVs are a threat to you — notice how you fear them.</p>
<p>These panels make for a good consciousness litmus test. The more developed and conscious you are, the more you are able hear all these diverse perspectives without judging them, recognizing them to be aspects of yourself.</p>
<p>Note: non-judgment does not mean that you adopt their opinions, nor does it mean that you adopt the average of all their opinions. Both would be a mistake.</p>

<title>The Cult Of Andrew Cohen</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-cult-of-andrew-cohen</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to share this video in the hopes that it will inoculate some of you against joining or starting enlightenment cults.</p>
<p>The key point: Just because the leader of a spiritual group has some degree of awakening does not mean it's not a cult! Many cults weave together legit spiritual teachings with devilry. Think twice before joining any spiritual community.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I randomly stumbled upon this southern military guy on Youtube and was pleasantly surprised by his progressive thinking! It's great to see some military folk and southern folk speaking out against the dangers of modern conservativism. This is what I call smart patriotism.</p>
<p>This dude's dishing out some serious common sense. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/unvoicedproject/videos" target="_blank">his channel</a> for more gems. Although I disagree with his deeper advocacy of anarchism. Anarchism cannot work at the scale of 100s of millions of people.</p>

<title>New York Post UFO Series</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/new-york-post-ufo-series</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It's ironic that the New York Post — a trashy, gossipy, right-wing tabloid said to be a favorite newspaper of Donald Trump — would be capable of producing a high-quality, well-researched mini-series about UFOs.</p>
<p>But here it is! Sometimes you find a diamond in a pile of shit. This series is well done and worth watching with an open mind.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaSY2Zc0goQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There are many episodes in the series:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z25NfZ0Ea9c" target="_blank">Episode 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDUF4NtYtxU" target="_blank">Episode 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=656VqWTnKmw" target="_blank">Episode 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5tIevquP0" target="_blank">Episode 5</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaYfsxbiKsM" target="_blank">Episode 6</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And they are still releasing new episodes each week, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>As always, think critically for yourself about this controversial topic. I am not suggesting you construct a UFO ideology but rather consider the empirical evidence in an openminded fashion. You don't know what you don't know. I find the mountains of evidence hard to explain away as mere delusion or fantasy. Something weird is going on.</p>

<title>The Power Of Imaginary Boundaries</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-power-of-imaginary-boundaries</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>One of our biggest themes with Actualized.org is understanding how the human mind, (and all of reality), creates boundaries. Notice that all of life runs on division, partition, distinction, and duality. Even at the most basic thermodynamic level, energy moves across difference gradients. No difference gradient, no movement, no life.</p>
<p>But it's not enough to understand this in the abstract. We must go deeper, examining concrete instances of how this manifests across human life. Which is why I love the following video. It shows you in concrete terms how division, partition, distinction, and duality shape all human behaviors.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5Ps1TZXAN8?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>All boundaries are imaginary. But notice how these imaginary boundaries serve as the fuel or engine driving all of life! Notice the enormous consequences that a single imaginary boundary can have. Now multiply this by infinity and you get LIFE!</p>
<p>What is war, conflict, disagreement, and violence about at the existential level? It's fighting over boundary definitions. Who's imaginary boundary will prevail? Who gets to say how the cake should be sliced?</p>
<p>Do you see the big picture of life?</p>
<p>If you object that some boundaries are physical and not merely imaginary, notice that that itself is an imaginary boundary which you created and are now defending! Since reality is one giant Universal Mind, all boundaries, including "physical" boundaries, exist within its imagination. To imagine a thing is to create a boundary between that thing and that which it is not. That's what being a thing is! That's what imagination is! Universal Mind is creating differences, which constitutes reality, which animates life, which leads to conflict, which leads to destruction of differences — thus going full-circle forever and ever, without beginning or end.</p>
<p>Division leading to unification leading back to division. Division within division within division. Unification after unification after unification.</p>
<p>That which is separated must ultimately unite. That which is united must ultimately separate. And in between, life happens. Ta-da!</p>
<p>Here's another brilliant micro example of how this plays out in human life:</p>

<title>Mapping Consciousness With High Dose LSD</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/mapping-consciousness-with-high-dose-lsd</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This is an exceptionally important video. Watch it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It's an outstanding interview with an academically trained philosopher who took 70+ high doses of LSD over 20 years to explore the deepest reaches of Universal Mind.</p>
<p>His growth curve closely matches my own after 65+ psychedelic trips over the last 2 years. It's a journey into ever deeper layers of Universal Mind and Infinite Consciousness which seems to have no end. Every trip leads to deeper and deeper understanding and integration of Universal Mind.</p>
<p>This is what the psychedelic spiritual path looks like. It's rare to see someone talking about it because most people trip merely for recreation and in serious circles psychedelics are stigmatized. Few people turn psychedelics into a serious spiritual path, but I see that changing in the future as the stigma gradually erodes.</p>

<title>Reverse-Engineering UFO Spacecraft</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/reverse-engineering-ufo-spacecraft</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A damn fascinating interview by Joe Rogan:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEWz4SXfyCQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Is it true?</p>
<p>I have no direct experience of UFOs, but Lazar's story seems highly plausible. There are just too many eye-witness accounts of UFOs at this point to deny their underlying reality. The skeptical position is more deluded than the thousands of eye-witness accounts.</p>
<p>Of course in the end, all aliens are just part of Infinite Consciousness. So it's really not a big deal. Realizing Infinite Consciousness is way more radical than reverse-engineering UFO spacecraft. Discovering aliens is peanuts compared to what you will discover at the moment of awakening: it's all imaginary! Dogs, cats, trees, people, aliens, Earth, history, science, the universe, birth, death, suffering, memories, your parents, etc. If you can experience it, you are imagining it.</p>
<p>The conspiracy is not that the government is hiding aliens from you. The real conspiracy is that you are imagining the government!</p>
<p>P.S. You should also distinguish UFOs from DMT entities. These are not the same thing. UFOs are within the human physical dimension. DMT entities are in another dimension entirely.</p>

<title>3 Kinds Of Socialism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/3-kinds-of-socialism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Mainstream culture does a terrible job of informing people what socialism actually means. There's much fear-mongering and confusion surrounding this word. Professor Richard Wolff is great antidote to such ignorance.</p>
<p>With that said, please take a nuanced view of this issue. I am not posting this to convert you to socialism, but rather to get you thinking about the limits of capitalism. I have some important critiques of socialism, so it's not as simple as me favoring socialism over capitalism. And I don't agree with everything that Richard Wolff advances. But there is much to be learned from his presentations and I recommend you think about this topic critically yet openmindedly and come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7x7oVwhHok?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>While I don't consider myself a socialist (I enjoy private ownership of my business), the limits of capitalism are simply undeniable at this point. We need to look towards the next evolution of our economy. That will not be pure capitalism nor pure socialism but some hybrid system. The question then becomes where to draw the lines. This requires a nuanced, non-ideological understanding of the pros and cons of both systems.</p>
<p>The point of upgrading our economic system is to allow as many people as possible to have the financial freedom to maximize the development of their consciousness. Our current economic system is so unfair and oppressive that most human beings on the planet are so deeply stuck in wage slavery that they are seriously hampered in their ability to develop their consciousness. And this ends up costing the entire human species.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of socialism which Richard Wolff talks about is democratizing the workplace. The core problem under our current system is that workers do not have any voting power or ownership share within the companies they work for. This effectively makes corporations dictatorships, with a few powerful elites dictating the corporation's actions, reaping all the rewards, and pocketing all the productivity gains from technological innovation. The stockholders of most corporations do not work in the corporation, creating a conflict between their agenda for max dividends and the needs of the people who do the actual daily work in the corporation. This then leads to gross wealth inequality across society as the rich get richer and richer beyond anything they reasonably need, while the vast majority struggle to survive. Since the workers have zero voting power they are easily exploited because their agenda rarely a concern for the all-powerful corporate dictators. These corporate dictatorships then turn into metastasizing cancers which become so powerful no individual can ever compete with them. These giant corporations create monopolies which eat up many opportunities for small independent entrepreneurs, leaving people with little choice but wage slavery.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the solution to this problem is not easy or clear. But we have no choice but to figure it out. And we cannot figure it out unless the population is properly educated about capitalism and socialism in a nuanced way.</p>
<p>P.S. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/democracyatwrk/videos" target="_blank">Richard Wolff's YouTube channel</a> for more.</p>

<title>Bernie Sanders Visionary</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>This is what outstanding, visionary leadership looks like:</p>

<p>Notice that visionary leadership is not meek or neutral. It is bold and decisive. It is not afraid to challenge cultural norms and call out devilry.</p>
<p>This is exactly what America and the world needs.</p>
<p>But of course the devils will not just standby and let a visionary do his thing. They will resist every step of the way out of selfishness, fear, ignorance, and closedmindedness.</p>

<title>Catch Me If You Can</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/catch-me-if-you-can</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I like this talk by the real-life person from the movie, Catch Me If You Can.</p>
<p>Frank Abagnale's life of con-artistry is a perfect case-study in how survival and devilry work.</p>
<p>What's great about his story is that in the end he redeemed himself (if he is to be believed). He now works for the FBI helping catch devils like his former self.</p>

<title>Thoughts On Unconditional Love</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/thoughts-on-unconditional-love</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This is an entry from my private journal which I wrote to myself. It shows my thought process in coming to grips with advanced spiritual truths:</p>
<p>Why can't I love unconditionally? Why don't humans love unconditionally? Because we have survival requirements. Because I am a specific way, I am predisposed to love certain things more than others. Of course I am going to love something which suits me more than I will love something which doesn't. Of course I will love a calm, smart, pretty child more than I will love a noisy, angry, ugly, crippled child. Because these things materially affect me. As a human I don't have God's infinite freedom and invulnerability. It's easy for the Godhead to love unconditionally because it is formless! It cannot lose anything. It cannot be harmed or annoyed. So is truly unconditional love possible for humans? Even enlightened humans? Seems unlikely. Unconditional love would only be possible with total selflessness. You'd have to really not care any more about living, dying, or enduring all sorts of hardship, suffering, and annoyance. To set up the ideal that I must always be unconditionally love could easily become a recipe for unhappiness and misery, as I will always fail to live up to such an impossible ideal. Then again, maybe unconditional love really is possible. But even if it is, it is certainly not something I can will or act my way into. It would have to come as an organic byproduct of deep awakening, higher states of consciousness, purification of the chakras, total surrender of the ego, and transcendence of self. Unconditional love would only be possible at the moment of total God-realization. The realization would have to be so total that there would be zero difference between myself and God, not just as a knowing, and not just temporarily as a peak experience, but as it is embodied day to day, minute to minute. Has any human ever attained such a degree of God-realization? I don't know. If they have, it would be a remarkable feat and I'm not sure how realistic it is to try to replicate it. It's certainly not something that the average spiritual seeker can do. I'm not sure if I could do it. You would have to completely renounce your entire life to reach this level of realization. It would have to be the only thing your life is about. I do not see that most monks or yogis have this level of God-realization in practice. Perhaps a few do, but this tells you just how difficult it is and why such people would be worshiped as Gods if they did exist — they literally are Gods at this point. You would be worshiped as God, but you would be so selfless at this point that you would not care at all for the praise. An interesting paradox. Half the world would worship you and love for your saintly self-sacrifice and half the world would hate you because your demonstration of such a radical degree of love would deeply threaten their egos. And you wouldn't care which was which because you would love both types equally. As a result, you would likely be killed by someone in the mob. And you still would not care. Which would only make your followers worship you even more after your death and create a religion which deluded others into worshiping you rather than realizing God as themselves.</p>

<title>Denver Decriminalizes Mushrooms</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/denver-decriminalizes-mushrooms</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/8/18535475/denver-psilocybin-psychedelic-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization-vote" target="_blank">Denver Successfully Decriminalizes Mushrooms</a></p>
<p>Horray! A small step for mankind.</p>
<p>This is exciting and groundbreaking news, as in the history books it will go down as the first domino to fall in our effort towards full nationwide decriminalization of psychedelics.</p>
<p>In truth, decriminalization of psychedelics is still not good enough. The US Constitution must have an Amendment which explicitly guarantees the right to explores one's own consciousness via any means that does not harm others.</p>
<p>This is of course on top of the already existing Constitutional clauses which guarantee free exercise of religion, which of course includes psychedelics (but is not yet acknowledged).</p>
<p>But we'll take this for now.</p>
<p>Oregon and California are working to pass legalization of mushrooms in 2020. A victory in Oregon would be a huge breakthrough, and it now seems doable.</p>
<p>Please donate to the <a href="https://psi-2020.org/" target="_blank">Oregon 2020 Psilocybin Ballot Initiative</a> to ensure it passes. If it does, that will be huge leap forward. It will also help many people suffering from depression, addiction, PTSD, anxiety, terminal illnesses, etc. Check out their video page for more details.</p>
<p>And here's another good initiative you can donate to if you're passionate about this cause: <a href="https://heffter.org/" target="_blank">The Heffter Research Institute</a></p>

<title>Elite Universities Are A Scam</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/elite-universities-are-a-scam</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Most people in society are in denial about the scam that is elite university education (and to some extent, university education in general).</p>
<p>Read this article: <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/1/18311548/college-admissions-secrets-myths" target="_blank">Former Admissions Dean Spills The Dirt On Elite College Admissions</a></p>
<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the kind of devilry that goes on behind the scenes of these elite universities. Do not trust them for a second!</p>
<p>Universities are not your friend. They are businesses, collective egos, bureaucracies, and cultural constructions, first and foremost. It is a big mistake to equate university education, rank, or credentials with any sign of truth, goodness, wisdom, intelligence, consciousness, self-awareness, or level of development.</p>
<p>The wisest humans are not to be found in universities because universities do not prioritize truth, wisdom, love, or consciousness. Elite universities are playing games of status, money, and politics, and the worst thing about it is, the biggest con they pull is convincing high school students that they are somehow important and to be valued. It's never even told to high school students that they can provide themselves with a much better education than any university ever could, and at a tiny fraction of the cost. High school students just automatically buy into the lie that elite universities are somehow important and desirable.</p>
<p>Universities indoctrinate. They do not teach truly original thinking or human growth. And as the devil tends to do, they call themselves the bastions of truth. Then they act outraged if you question their authority or their well-credentialed professors. Ha! What a load of horse shit! A credential is just a piece of paper that a group of devils wrote to themselves to convince themselves that they are not devils but angels.</p>
<p>The whole point of getting an elite university degree is so that your survival in life becomes much easier thanks to the status it confers — you get access to the best job opportunities and positions of power — so you don't then actually have to work hard on becoming a conscious human being or doing original creative high-value work that stands on its own merit. An elite university allows you to use the power of social status to increase your survival odds. That's what it's really about, and any honest university would admit it. But of course the devil has to hide and deny his devilry in order for it to keep working. Teens who apply to these universities do not understand any of this. They are just cogs in the unconscious machine. Just like their parents were. They are under the illusion that these universities are somehow the ticket to heaven when really they're a ticket to hell! You know what they say, an abused child becomes an abusive parent. And so the cycle continues, the cogs keep spinning around in circles.</p>
<p>And all this is not to even mention the scam which is the college loan system. From a certain perspective a modern university is just a clever invention for saddling a new human being with $100,000 in debt without that human realizing what just happened. That is the lifeblood of the whole system! Universities are like a vampire that feeds off wage slaves. The real devilry comes in convincing children to join this system eagerly. You could call our entire education system long-time-horizon child abuse: grades, homework, standardized testing, SAT prep, AP testing, college admissions, student loans, credentials, diplomas, fraternities, sororities, college athletics — all that. It's all a socially constructed scam; a house of cards held together with bullshit. By the time a human being goes through 12 + 4 years of that, she is a domesticated animal. It's just a more sophisticated version of religion. A religion masquerading as science and rationality. No wonder there is no God or Truth found there. You cannot institutionalize Truth.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, an elite university education will actually hinder your ability to become the best human being you could be. Take responsibility for your own education. The only one who can properly educate you is yourself.</p>
<p>And yet, despite having said all the above, a university education is still far better than no education at all, or some kind of parochial education. So in a twisted sense we need this devil to save us from the yet greater devil of uneducatedness and right-wing ideology.</p>
<p>P.S. Do not confuse my critique of universities for right-wing critiques of universities. Universities can be critiqued from above or from below. My critique is from above. Right-wing critiques — based on a knee-jerk reaction against liberal values, multi-culturalism, relativism, and post-modernism — are from below. The paradox is that American society would be far better off if we made all public universities totally free to everyone, doubled their annual budgets, and cancelled all student debt. This would also have the benefit of devaluing elite private universities and reduce the need to jump through hoops for scholarships.</p>
<p>Our education system is thoroughly corrupt and badly in need of reform and massive funding. Of course it's just as you should expect. The first thing on the devil's agenda is to seize and corrupt all wellsprings of truth, turning them into founts of devilry. Topmost on the devil's agenda is to break all the lights, break all the mirrors, and multiply himself in the shade.</p>

<title>Ayn Rand's Stage Orange Witchdoctory</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/ayn-rands-stage-orange-witchdoctory</link>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>"While scientists were performing astounding feats of disciplined reason [during the Enlightenment], breaking down the barriers of the 'unknowable' in every field of knowledge, charting the course of light rays in space or the course of blood in the capillaries of man’s body — what philosophy was offering them, as interpretation of and guidance for their achievements was the plain Witchdoctory of Hegel, who proclaimed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">matter does not exist at all</span>, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything is Idea</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not somebody’s idea, just <i>Idea</i></span>), and that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this Idea operates by the dialectical process</span> of a new '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">super-logic</span>' which proves that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contradictions are the law of reality</span>, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A is non-A</span>, and that omniscience about the physical universe (including electricity, gravitation, the solar system, etc.) is to be derived, not from the observation of facts, but from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contemplation of that Idea</span>’s triple somersaults inside his, Hegel’s, mind. This was offered as a philosophy of reason."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand" target="_blank">Ayn Rand</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And she was precisely wrong!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It takes skill and effort to be this wrong. The skill of a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/what-is-the-devil" target="_blank">devil</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Stage Orange</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism" target="_blank">materialism</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism" target="_blank">rationalism</a> underestimates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism" target="_blank">idealism</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism" target="_blank">mysticism</a> by assuming it to be philosophical mental-masturbation with no real-world consequences, when of course the truth is that materialism/rationalism is itself thoroughly deluded because it fails to take into account higher states of consciousness, which, if achieved, will erase the illusion of a material or rational world altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here Ayn Rand demonstrates the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5Qn6K36Ug" target="_blank">pre/trans fallacy</a>: confusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" target="_blank">Hegel</a>'s trans-rational explanations of the Absolute with pre-rational myth, fundamentalist religion, and soft thinking. In truth, Ayn Rand's dualistic logic was closer to myth than Hegel's.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The great irony is that materialism and rationalism turn out to be Witchdoctory — the very thing they accused philosophy and religion of being! Such is the counter-intuitive nature of the mind. To a devil like Ayn Rand, black is white, up is down, light is dark, and Absolute Truth is fiction. I've noticed that people who make vehement appeal to "reason" (like Ayn Rand or Sam Harris) turn out to be some of the greatest devils because they assume that reason is somehow a guarantor of truth, when in fact reason does the bidding of the ego. You cannot get to Absolute Truth through reason. Which totally shocks stage Orange rationalists, because they always held in blind faith that you could. A rationalist is just someone who replaces fundamentalist religious faith in the inerrancy of The Bible or Koran with a fundamentalist faith in the inerrancy of reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hegel was a spiritual genius. He was the Western/German version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna" target="_blank">Nagarjuna</a> or The Buddha. But his words fell on deaf ears and got confined to history books or philosophy lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Interestingly, when you start to research Western intellectual tradition you find a strong thread of idealism running all throughout which few Westerners today know about or take seriously. This gives a false impression that the West has always been materialist and anti-mystical, and that science has always been a materialist enterprise. Not true. This is an artificial narrative constructed by materialists to relieve themselves of the responsibility of taking idealist notions seriously. Many of the West's greatest scientists, thinkers, and visionaires were idealists, and for good reason. Because the more intelligent you become, the more idealism becomes unavoidable. Realist scientists and thinkers are 2nd rate intellects. They are good at technical analysis but they lack the holistic visionary aspect of the intellect, which is the most important aspect.</p>
<p>The intellect has two functions: analysis and synthesis, or division and unification. The intellect can be used to carve up reality or stitch it together. Modern academic and Western intellectual culture is overly biased towards analysis at the expense of synthesis, vision-logic, unification, and big picture thinking. Our schools teach kids how to carve up reality but not how to stitch it together. As a result our science and our society is overly-autistic and disconnected from our humanity and our divinity. Modern science lacks heart and vision. Which doesn't mean that science is bad or all-wrong, it just means that modern science is highly partial, and that there is a higher version of science yet to be actualized. Science and reason are not to be abandoned but expanded.</p>

<title>Spiral Dynamics Case Study</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/spiral-dynamics-case-study</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a beautiful video demonstrating the difference in worldview and reality of stage <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Blue</a> vs <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">Orange</a>/<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">Green</a>.</p>
<p>Here's Orange/Green reacting against stage Blue.</p>
<p>Notice that Orange/Green simply cannot understand the stage Blue worldview because it's biased by an unquestioned certainty in the materialist paradigm. What stage Orange/Green does not understand is that there is no such thing as objective reality, "facts", "truth", or "sanity".</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruh0RqzHmC0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Stage Blue vs Orange/Green are literally inhabiting different realities which their minds are constructing. But since they do not understand that their mind constructs reality, they assume that their reality is the one "true" reality while the other side is literally insane. This notion of insanity plays a pivotal function in their worldview because they need some way of explaining away the otherwise without actually investigating it. By calling the other side "insane" it automatically absolves you from having to seriously question your notion of "real".</p>
<p>What needs to be realized is that however you think reality is, you're making that up! "No Leo, I'm not making it up. You're crazy!" << You just made that up! Lol. See? Your metaphysical assumptions become your reality, no matter how crazy, unreasonable, or false they are. So if you believe there is an objective external reality, that becomes your reality. But it is not true in any absolute sense. Your mind is making reality up as you go along. Including, of course, the denial that you do so.</p>
<p>There actually is no firm boundary between a crazy worldview and a reasonable one. That duality collapses upon deep examination.</p>
<p>Without deeply understanding this you will never understand what reality is, how it works, or why humans behave as they do. For you there will always be stuff that happens in the world which seems totally batshit crazy. But it only appears that way from your POV because your worldview is inadequate at accounting for other worldviews. As a rule of thumb, any time you see something crazy happening in the world, that's a clue that you don't understand it deeply enough. The mind uses the judgment "that's crazy" as a cop-out.</p>
<p>With all that said, some people are exceptionally deluded.</p>

<title>Fat Leo</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/fat-leo</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Folks have been asking me to release a photo of when I used to be fat. Some even accused me of making up the story that I used to be fat. Well, I was in fact fat from about age 9 to age 21.</p>
<p>I didn't have fat photos of myself because: 1) Back then there were no cell phones or selfie pics, 2) I didn't like taking photos of myself when I was fat.</p>
<p>But anyhow, I finally found an old photo at my Mom's house. So here you go:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4203" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/leo-pic-01.png" alt="leo-pic-01" width="604" height="842" /></p>
<p>235 lbs at 6'2". 20 years old. About one year after this photo was taken I lost 65 pounds in 5 months, dropping to 170 lbs. I've kept it off ever since. Right now I'm at 180 lbs.</p>
<p>This was accomplished through diet changes & lots of gym exercise, including cardio and weights. I worked out 5 days a week for about 10 years. For the past 2 years I have not worked out at all and still keep the weight off because my diet is about 10x cleaner than it used to be, such that exercise for purposes of weight-maintenance is unnecessary. But exercise is still good for health of course.</p>
<p>Big change is possible if you set your mind on it. The most important aspects of accomplishing a change like this are: 1) vision, 2) discipline, and 3) focus.</p>
<p>Because my videos are so abstract and metaphysical sometimes people overlook the meat of this work. Personal development is very practical stuff with very tangible results. Don't let the abstract explanations fool you. You must also be results-oriented. Get shit done by whatever means necessary. Claw your way up <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/using-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-to-self-actualize" target="_blank">Maslow's Hierarchy</a>. If you're new to personal development you need to dial in the basics like health, diet, career, finances, living environment, family situation, dating, etc. Don't get so metaphysical that you neglect all that. You will find awakening impossible if you can't even stop eating junk food or can't earn enough to pay your rent.</p>

<title>So Are You Chinese Or Japanese?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/so-are-you-chinese-or-japanese</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a perfect little example of <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/understanding-duality-part-1" target="_blank">dualistic thinking</a>:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_CaZ4EAexQ?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This kind of thinking is extremely common at <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-blue" target="_blank">Spiral Dynamics Stage Blue</a>. But watch out! — dualistic thinking is still present in spades at higher stages. It's not just rednecks who think in this black-and-white way. You do it every day! Don't fool yourself into thinking you're above dualistic thinking. Dualistic thinking can be very subtle and it affects even the most rational and scientific thinkers. Rationality and science are chock full of dualities.</p>
<p>There's more to reality than the simplistic categories your mind creates.</p>

<title>James Cameron On Ecological Awareness</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a really intelligent and self-aware perspective on ecology & environment. It's a stage Yellow perspective. Notice the nuance and complexity of it. It balances science, business, art, and compassion, transcending AND including stages Orange and Green. Notice the lack of blaming problems on someone else. Notice the attitude of meeting people where they're at. Notice how science & spirituality/religion are not pitted against each other. It's a cooperation of left and right brain, mind & heart. Notice the systems thinking.</p>

<title>Quintessence: The 5th Element</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/quintessence-the-5th-element</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Classically, the 4 elements were Air, Water, Fire, and Earth. The 5th element — which few people know about — was called the quintessence (literally, "the 5th essence") or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)" target="_blank">Aether</a> — otherwise known as Nothingness or Emptiness or Void.</p>
<p>In science, Aether was known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether" target="_blank">luminiferous ether</a>, the medium through which light and gravity waves were supposed to have propagated. In the early 20th century physicists like Einstein and others "debunked" the notion of ether by reasoning that light waves did not need a medium to propagate through. They ran various experiments trying to measure the existence of ether but nothing turned up, so they discarded the notion as superfluous. Except Aether is not superfluous, it is central! What the scientists did not understand, and still do not understand, is that Aether wasn't a measurable medium like water, air, or even space — it is Nothing! This is not the same as saying that Aether does not exist. Aether exists as Nothing, the Groundless Ground, or pure Existence itself — existence devoid of any content. Don't bother trying to measure it because you can't. Existence is prior to measurement. The medium for the propagation of light waves and gravity waves (and anything else for that matter) is consciousness. And also don't confuse Aether/Nothingness with the vacuum of space. Aether is prior to space or time. It "holds" space and time.</p>
<p>What people don't understand is that quintessence is not just Nothingness, it is not just Existence, it is also Consciousness, Truth, God, Love, Goodness, Intelligence, Self, Other, and World!</p>
<p>But how can Love be Nothingness? How could it not! Only Nothingness has the capacity to embrace all. Only Nothingness is selfless enough to embrace all. Only no-thing can unconditionally accept every-thing. The embrace is so complete that Nothingness literally IS everything! This is pure, Platonic Love. Not just love as an emotion (although it is that too), but love as Being itself. Love is the union of all opposites into one seamless totality. Love is the unification of all divisions. Love is the super-set of all sub-sets. Love is universality. Love is infinity. Love is unlimited.</p>
<p>The 5th Element got their metaphysics exactly right:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6a0Q0rfbUVI?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>After all is said and done, in the final analysis, the force that saves the world is none other than the force that makes the world: Love.</p>
<p>You ARE quintessence. You ARE Love.</p>
<p>Your ability to unify all opposites, all dualities, is the measure of your love. It is Unity as an Absolute. A Unity so all-embracing it has no opposite. A nonduality so nondual it doesn't know duality. A Love so complete it does not know judgment, criticism, rejection, hatred, selfishness, or evil. Yet at the same time it embraces them all by being them all. Human love is a tiny branch off the tree of universal Love. This tree is infinite, with countless branches of varying size. You are one branch AND you are the entire tree. To actualize one branch is to be human. To actualize the entire tree is to be God. Each branch is not other than the tree, such that all there is, is tree. What it means to be a tree is to be each branch and the sum total of them all at once. To realize this totality is Truth and Love.</p>
<p>Notice, when you feel an emotion of deep love, what you're feeling is not an egoic desire but a selflessness and a deep unity with the universe. In that moment you are being selfless, and it feels right and good. It feels divine.</p>
<p>So how do you conquer evil? By experiencing yourself as Love. Just like in the clip above. It sounds childish, until you try to do it and you quickly see just how hard it is for your ego to do. It is the mark of a masterful sage to be able to embrace all. You can't do it because you have too much evil in you. All-encompassing Love threatens you like light threatens a shadow. You can't do it because you are too busy defending your self while Love is self-less-ness. Love is also fearlessness. If there is no self, there is nothing to lose, and nothing to fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"A coward is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">— Mahatma Gandhi</p>

<title>&quot;I Cannot Self-Terminate&quot;</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/i-cannot-self-terminate</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Terminator 2 is — in my opinion — one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid the final scene always moved me:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEMICfWLOig?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>It's such a brilliant final scene, filled with spiritual significance.</p>
<p>Now I understand why I liked it so much. It represents the hardest things for an ego to do: self-terminate. It represents the stark brutality of total selflessness.</p>
<p>How do you ask a self to self-terminate?</p>
<p>You see? That is why this work is hard.</p>
<p>"Be melting snow. Wash yourself of yourself." — Rumi</p>
<p>WARNING: Do not confuse self-termination with suicide. I am talking about spiritual self-termination. Suicide is just more ego.</p>

<title>The Joy Of Creation</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-joy-of-creation</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It took some gamer-nerd 300 hours to build this epic roller coaster. When I saw it, it reminded me of God's infinite creative potential — of how life and reality just goes on and on and on like an endless roller coaster.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/afhBFffMvZU?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>You might wonder, "So what? Why would someone waste 300 hours creating this silly thing? What the point?" The point is CREATION itself! God likes to create amazing stuff just for the hell of it. When you have infinite creative capacity, when you have unlimited intelligence, when you have unlimited power, when you have an eternity — what else are you gonna do? You have somewhere you gotta be?</p>
<p>CREATION is its own end. As you go chasing awakening and Nothingness, do not overlook CREATION! It's everywhere and everything! You might look at this roller coaster and see some gamer-nerd making something pointless. But that's not some nerd, that's God! That is the unlimited creative force of the whole universe materializing itself into a roller coaster! God is the sum total of all chains of creation, of which this roller coaster is one chain. That force is designing everything from atoms to cells to animals to galaxies and beyond. Can you see it? It is unlimited creation. It cannot stop. It bursts infinitely with new creative forms and ideas, ultimately spawning everything that can ever be.</p>
<p>If life feels depressing and bleak, it's because you're failing to step into your role as Creator. Creation is a spiritual activity. Every time that gamer-nerd works on perfecting his roller coaster, he's in church. And when you look upon and delight in his creation, recognizing the God in it, you are in church. What if your work and your church were one and the same? Wouldn't that be a life worth living?</p>
<p>Never forget, you are a creator. You are THE creator. What are you gonna create with your life?</p>
<p>I hope it's something at least as cool as this rollercoaster.</p>
<p>P.S. Notice what the guy in the video says at the very end of the ride, at timestamp 10:02. He says, "OH. MY. GOD!" That's right. That's exactly right.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca3eYxZedD4" target="_blank">epic Aliens rollercoaster</a>.</p>

<title>Bernie 2020!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/bernie-2020</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Today Bernie Sanders announced his entry in the 2020 Presidential race and I am thrilled to endorse him. I don't typically endorse politicians, but he is by far the best politician in the country today. He is a serious visionary leader and his policy platform is outstanding. If you want to live in a more conscious, less plutocratic America, please <a href="https://berniesanders.com" target="_blank">donate</a> & support Bernie because the establishment ego backlash against him will be yuge!</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgJagAiHimk?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Sanders' 2020 policy platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicare 4 All</li>
<li>Green New Deal/climate</li>
<li>$15 min wage</li>
<li>Criminal justice reform</li>
<li>Free college</li>

<li>Opposing military industrial complex</li>
<li>Legalization of weed</li>
<li>Abolish private prisons</li>
<li>End cash bail</li>
<li>Major police department reform</li>
</ul>
<p>Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is. If you are short on cash, consider volunteering for <a href="https://act.berniesanders.com/signup/volunteer" target="_blank">his campaign</a>, the <a href="https://www.justicedemocrats.com" target="_blank">Justice Democrats</a>, or <a href="https://www.wolf-pac.com" target="_blank">Wolf-PAC</a> to get corporate money out of government.</p>

<title>Textbook Example Of Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/textbook-example-of-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't particularly like to kick a man when he's down, but the following video shows the unraveling of Alex Jones' ego in such a stark way that it deserves to be in a textbook about devilry. Pay close attention to how the arrogance of the ego-mind refuses to concede to truth and love, doubling down on its egotism and starting a holy war (lesser Jihad). This is how crusades and holy wars throughout history have been started.</p>
<p>Alex Jones is just an extremely obvious example of this. But notice how your ego does this too, in (hopefully) lesser, more subtle ways. It especially happens when you feel under attack or when your livelihood or identity is seriously threatened.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL1ShzYHvD8?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>As context for this clip, on his podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B93fUUiuwMs" target="_blank">Joe Rogan extended a hand of friendship to Alex Jones</a>, genuinely concerned for his mental health. Joe took a fair, compassionate position, being more than generous to Alex Jones, but the devil cannot stand it! The devil is terrified of genuine love and compassion — he thinks it's a ploy. Love burns the devil like a sunlight burns a vampire. Rogan is speaking from a healthy stage Green while Jones is speaking from a very pathological stage Red. Stage Green often underestimates the depravity and viciousness stage Red is capable of — it is outside of stage Green's reality.</p>
<p>The fundamental position of the devil in aggressive defiance of God. At low levels of Spiral Development the ego becomes aggressively ignorant and, of course, assumes the position of God. The devil always feels like he is the righteous one who could do no wrong and that God is on his side. The devil is a usurper of God's throne, actively spinning delusions and self-deceptions to convince himself that what he's doing is righteous.</p>
<p>Remember this: a devil will not hesitate to bite a helping hand. So be careful when openly offering them your compassion.</p>
<p>P.S. Please don't misunderstand me when I call Alex Jones a devil. Despite how it sounds, I am not actually demonizing him. When I call someone "a devil" I do not use this term dualistically or moralistically. I am not making a moral judgment of him. For me this is a technical term describing delusional egoic behavior which aims at supplanting truth with its own selfishness. Like how a cuckoo bird tries to lay its own egg in the nest of other birds.</p>

<title>Entrainment Demo</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/entrainment-demo</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Check out this cool video demonstrating entrainment:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aaxw4zbULMs?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice at the end how they all de-sync without the soda cans.</p>
<p>Consider that the soda cans are culture. Culture allows human beings to entrain with each other. Which is why people defend their cultures to the death.</p>
<p>P.S. Your brain gets entrained to certain types of sounds and music just like the pendulums above. Various spiritual techniques make use of such brain entrainment — like binaural beats, Solfeggio frequencies, chanting, mantra recitation, and shamanic drumming — in order to access higher states of consciousness. Is this New Age voodoo? No! Does it really work? Yes! Give it a try, if you dare. There is a spooky yet legit connection between your state of consciousness and auditory vibrations.</p>

<title>Profound Quotes #014</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/profound-quotes-014</link>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Abandon the search for God and the Creation and other matters of a similar sort. Look for him by taking yourself as the starting point. Learn who it is within you who makes everything his own and says, 'My God, my mind, my thought, my soul, my body.' Learn the sources of sorrow, joy, love, hate. Learn how it happens that one watches without willing, rests without willing, becomes angry without willing, loves without willing. If you carefully investigate these matters you will find him in yourself."</p>

<title>Neoclassical Economics Is A Cult</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/neoclassical-economics-is-a-cult</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Free-market capitalism (especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics" target="_blank">Chicago School</a>) is a dangerous cult ideology. Similar to positivism, behaviorism, and materialism. A lot of otherwise intelligent people get sucked into them because the group-think and status quo is so strong it goes completely unquestioned, masquerading as "science" or "fact". The devil loves to lie using mathematics because it gives him the perfect cover of "objectivity".</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JeplRmADW3E?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course Marxism also tends to be cult-like. But right now America has a serious addiction to capitalism, to the point of being in denial about it.</p>

<title>A Strange Loop Universe</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/a-strange-loop-universe</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Consider the following intriguing possibility:</p>
<p>According to modern cosmology, our universe started as an infinite singularity which spontaneously blew up and started expanding at an accelerating rate, which it is still doing today. There has been some speculation that in the future it might start to decelerate and eventually crash in on itself in a Big Crunch, back to where it began. An elegant solution, but our universe currently shows no sign of deceleration so I wouldn't hold my breath. So let's assume it just keeps accelerating outwardly forever. What then? How do we end it in an elegant way?</p>
<p>Thermodynamics tells us that ultimately the universe will end in entropic heat death, where all the atoms dissipate their kinetic energy until the entire universe is one energetically uniform, lukewarm field. This is the universe's most boring state. Nothing interesting to see or do because everything is so uniform that everywhere is the same. There's nowhere to go and you don't have enough of an energy gradient to power anything (no cars, no power plants, no life). Everything is one uniform temperature and eventually even all the atoms decompose into a perfectly uniform soup.</p>
<p>But at precisely this point our perfectly uniform universe also becomes indistinguishable from a singularity! Now, you might think, "But wait a minute, this new singularity is a billion times larger than the old one, due to billions of years of expansion." Except size, distance, and time are all relative notions. In a totally uniform universe it is impossible to distinguish distance or time and hence impossible to distinguish the old singularity from the new singularity, making them literally identical!</p>
<p>After all, who is to say there is difference between beginning and end?</p>
<p>And suddenly the whole thing explodes again.</p>
<p>Ta-da! We've come full-circle!</p>
<p>But wait, it gets even stranger! If reality is nothing but distinction, could it be possible to eliminate the distinction between something and nothing, reality and unreality? After all, who is to say that the universe is real or has ever even happened?!</p>
<p>This very moment you are sitting here reading this sentence thinking you are inside an actual universe which has happened. But perhaps if you realized that "actual" is a distinction that you are creating, you could also collapse it, thus making it literally impossible to distinguish an "actual" universe from its opposite, a "potential" universe, thus nullifying this very moment, as though it never actually happened, all at the same time as it appears to be happening!</p>
<p>After all, who is to say there is a difference between happening and non-happening?</p>
<p>So, was there an actual Big Bang or not? Adapting, a bit, the famous words of Henry Ford, "Whether you think there was, or think there wasn't, you're right!"</p>
<p>How does God create something out of nothing? By imagining a difference between the two.</p>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
<p>So while everyone else is running around taking life seriously, you might be able to realize that life isn't happening at all. Perhaps existence is only possible as an idea.</p>
<p>Sounds insane? Who is to say there is a difference between sane and insane? ;)</p>
<p>Here's an interesting video long these lines, although not quite as radical. Modern cosmology is still not addressing the elephant in the room: the relativity of existence itself.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Consider the following intriguing possibility:</p>
<p>According to modern cosmology, our universe started as an infinite singularity which spontaneously blew up and started expanding at an accelerating rate — which is continuing today. There has been some speculation that in the future it might start to decelerate and eventually crash in on itself in a Big Crunch, back to where it began. An elegant solution, but our universe currently shows no sign of deceleration so I wouldn't hold my breath. So let's assume it just keeps accelerating outwardly forever. What then? How do we end it in an elegant way?</p>
<p>Thermodynamics tells us that ultimately the universe will end in entropic heat death, where all the atoms dissipate their kinetic energy until the entire universe is one energetically uniform, frozen field. This is the universe's most boring state. Nothing interesting to see or do because everything is so uniform that everywhere is the same. There's nowhere to go and you don't have enough of an energy gradient to power anything (no cars, no power plants, no life).

Now, you might think, "But wait a minute, this new singularity is a billion times larger than the old one, due to billions of years of expansion." Except size, distance, time, and temperature are all relative notions. In a totally uniform universe it is impossible to distinguish here from there, big from small, past from future, or hot from cold, and hence impossible to distinguish the old singularity from the new singularity, making them literally identical!</p>
<p>After all, who is to say there is difference between beginning and end?</p>
<p>And suddenly the whole thing explodes again.</p>
<p>Ta-da! We've come full-circle! The perfect <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">strange loop</a>.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets even stranger! If reality is nothing but distinction, could it be possible to eliminate the distinction between something and nothing, reality and unreality? After all, who is to say that the universe is real or has ever even happened?!</p>
<p>This very moment you are sitting here reading this sentence thinking you are inside an actual universe which has happened. But perhaps if you realized that "actual" is a distinction that you are creating, you could also collapse it, thus making it literally impossible to distinguish an "actual" universe from its opposite, a "potential" universe, thus nullifying this very moment, as though it never actually happened, all at the same time as it appears to be happening!</p>
<p>After all, who is to say there is a difference between happening and non-happening?</p>
<p>So, was there an actual Big Bang or not? Adapting, a bit, the famous words of Henry Ford, "Whether you think there was, or think there wasn't, you're right!"</p>
<p>How does God create something out of nothing? By imagining a difference between the two.</p>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
<p>So while everyone else is running around taking life seriously, you might be able to realize that life isn't happening at all. Perhaps existence is only possible as an idea.</p>
<p>Sounds impossible? Who is to say there is a difference between possible and impossible?</p>
<p>Sounds insane? Who is to say there is a difference between sane and insane? ;)</p>
<p>Here's an interesting video long these lines, although not quite as radical. Modern cosmology is still not addressing the elephant in the room: the relativity of existence itself.</p>

<title>Capitalist Devilry</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/capitalist-devilry</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I love Anand's analysis of the current state of American society. Everything he's talking about is the limits of Spiral Dynamics <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-orange" target="_blank">stage Orange</a> which I have explained in my video.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fdt5a6CJ3HY?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_zt3kGW1NM?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the kind of political analysis I'm into. Notice how different it is from the commonplace partisan bickering, namecalling, and conventional thinking.</p>
<p>Notice also how the themes he talks about are part of the much broader dynamic of devilry (see video <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/what-is-the-devil" target="_blank">What Is The Devil?</a>). Devilry is nothing other than the force of blind self-survival. This force is so strong because it needed to be that strong in order to get you to where you are right now. But then survival goes overboard, becoming counter-productive. As is always the case with duality, too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-- Upton Sinclair</p>
<p>Of course rich people are not going to understand how they create global suffering and inequality because it is against their self-interest to understand. That would be too much consciousness, too much responsibility. Then they could not pursue wealth as ruthlessly as they do. The devil is always going to resist seeing that he is the devil. This is true not just of rich people, but EVERYONE! Religious people, military people, Big Oil, Big Pharma, criminals, children — and YOU! I want you to notice that you are not conscious of the collateral damage that your own survival produces because it doesn't help your survival to be conscious of it. So you are in deep denial about it. Notice the stories and justifications you create for how you are not a devil but an angel. It is precisely these stories which make you a devil! Ta-da! Self-deception at its finest.</p>
<p>What's that you say? "But Leo! I need money, I need sex, I need medicine, I need a house, I need a good school for my kids, I need X, I need Y, I need Z. If I stop pursuing my survival needs, I will die!"</p>
<p>Exactly! Exactly...</p>

<title>My Political Awakening</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/my-political-awakening</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/312856887?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="615" height="345" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>While we're on the topic of politics, here are my favorite political channels on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSeder/videos" target="_blank">The Majority Report</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9oQdIk1MfcnzypG3UnURA/videos" target="_blank">The Rational National</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SecularTalk/videos" target="_blank">Secular Talk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MidweekPolitics/videos" target="_blank">The David Pakman Show</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoungTurks/videos" target="_blank">TYT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MikeAnthonyTV/videos" target="_blank">The Humanist Report</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/democracynow/videos" target="_blank">Democracy Now!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that I do not necessarily agree with all of the ideas & opinions these channels espouse. These are <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-green" target="_blank">stage Green</a> channels. They are definitely biased and ideological. My view of politics is at least <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/spiral-dynamics-stage-yellow" target="_blank">stage Yellow</a>, so I have some important criticisms of these Green channels, but in an environment where stage Yellow political analysis is virtually non-existent, this is as good as you're likely to find, for now. We have a lot of growing to do just to get society to Green, nevermind Yellow. There will definitely be some excessive and unhealthy manifestations of Green from time to time, but right now I'm not too concerned about it.</p>
<p>Rather than adopting my personal political beliefs, what I suggest you do with this domain of life is to study it (if you want). Become serious about understanding how government & society works in a systemic, non-partisan, non-culture-war way. Set aside your political prejudices and educate yourself. Be careful not to get radicalized and not to build a political ego. Be careful about confirmation bias. Diversify your news sources and seriously investigate the positions of your political opponents. But also don't fall into the trap of false equivalency, splitting issues evenly down the middle, or automatically accepting the status quo. By not making a choice, you've made a choice in favor of the status quo. By not taking action, you've taken action in defense of the status quo.</p>
<p>When it comes to politics, you're damned if you do, but you're even more damned if you don't.</p>
<p>If you are seriously working on enlightenment you might want to stay away from politics for a while so it doesn't turn into a distraction. But overall, you should be well-informed about various political trends and what makes for good governance. You might want to subscribe to a serious journalistic new outlet like the New York Times or Washington Post and actually read their articles. Also, read books on politics and governance. You cannot understand this domain of life without some in-depth reading and a sense of history.</p>
<p>Above all, remember, proper politics and governance is not about what YOU need. It's about what helps elevate the majority of mankind. Often times what's good for the greater system may not be what's personally good for you, your family, your ethnicity, your gender, or your company. Be very careful not to make politics just another survival game that your ego plays.</p>

<title>The Cult Of Capitalism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-cult-of-capitalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Excellent analysis of the current state of America:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-2TEwdRnX0?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice how Spiral Dynamics explains all this, and foreshadows the next inevitable development step. We are beginning to reach the limits of unbridled stage Orange.</p>
<p>Be careful not to turn the current state of society into a victim mindset or an excuse for why you can't create a great life. Never let aggregate macro trends dictate your personal effort and results. It doesn't really matter what others are failing to do, what matters is that you do what you need to do. Conscious capitalism is possible, and you can lead the way in that.</p>

<title>Inside The Alex Jones Cult</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/inside-the-alex-jones-cult</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's an outstanding interview by David Pakman with the wife of Alex Jones, offering a rare glimpse into the self-delusion and narcissism fueling the Alex Jone phenomenon.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebByb9JJgJg?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This is very typical of unhealthy Spiral Dynamics stage Red. Alex Jones is basically an online cult leader.</p>
<p>Watch out! The 21st century will see many more cults forming online. The online medium is ripe for exploitation and weaponization by devils proclaiming themselves to be angels. YouTube, Facebook, Google, Twitter, iTunes, Instagram, etc will all be hijacked by devils to some degree, in the same way that TV, radio, and newspapers were. The devil always thrives in newly developing media because they lack legal regulations and ethical norms. The devil thrives in the wild west, which is one of the fundamental flaws of anarchism and libertarianism. In a wild west environment the biggest devils will rule.</p>

<title>Inside The R. Kelly Sex Cult</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/inside-the-r-kelly-sex-cult</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I hope you get from watching my videos is just how timely, relevant, and practical all of the stuff we talk about is. Philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, psychology, and spirituality are not just some wooly academic pursuit, their effects are felt throughout culture every day. You can see it in the news every day if you know what to look for because the principles we discuss on Actualized.org are so fundamental they shape all human action across all geographical locations across all time.</p>
<p>Here's but one example:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2muGNE9t_s?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>This is a good example of a secular cult.</p>
<p>R. Kelly seems to exhibit quite a bit of unhealthy Spiral Dynamics stage Red, which is quite common for rappers and cult leaders.</p>

<title>Aztec Nonduality</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/aztec-nonduality</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Should it be any surprise at this point that the Aztecs were nondualists?</p>
<p>Here's a summary of Aztec metaphysics from the <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/" target="_blank">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"At the heart of Nahua (Meso-American) philosophy stands the thesis that there exists a single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power, energy or force: what the Nahuas called teotl (God)<em>. </em>Elizabeth Boone writes, 'The real meaning of teotl is spirit — a concentration of power as a sacred and impersonal force'. According to Jorge Klor de Alva, 'Teotl implies something more than the idea of the divine manifested in the form of a god or gods; instead it signifies the sacred in more general terms'. The multiplicity of gods in official, state sanctioned Aztec religion does not gainsay this claim, for this multiplicity was merely the sacred, merely teotl, 'separated, as it were by the prism of human sight, into its many attributes'.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teotl continually generates and regenerates as well as permeates, encompasses, and shapes the cosmos as part of its endless process of self-generation and regeneration. That which humans commonly understand as nature — e.g. heavens, earth, rain, humans, trees, rocks, animals, etc. — is generated by teotl, from teotl as one aspect, facet, or moment of its endless process of self-generation-and-regeneration. Yet teotl is more than the unified totality of things; <strong>teotl is identical with everything and everything is identical with teotl</strong>. Since identical with teotl, the cosmos and its contents ultimately transcend such dichotomies as personal vs. impersonal, animate vs. inanimate, etc. As the single, all-encompassing life force of the universe, teotl vivifies the cosmos and its contents. Lastly, <strong>teotl is both metaphysically immanent and transcendent</strong>. It is immanent in that it penetrates deeply into every detail of the universe and exists within the myriad of created things; it is transcendent in that it is not exhausted by any single, existing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nahua metaphysics is processive. Process, movement, becoming and transmutation are essential attributes of teotl. Teotl is properly understood as ever-flowing and ever-changing energy-in-motion — not as a discrete, static entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although essentially processive and devoid of any permanent order, the ceaseless becoming of the cosmos is nevertheless characterized by an overarching balance, rhythm, and regularity: one provided by and constituted by teotl... Dialectical polar monism holds that: (1) the cosmos and its contents are substantively and formally identical with teotl; and (2) teotl presents itself primarily as the ceaseless, cyclical oscillation of polar yet complementary opposites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teotl's process presents itself in multiple aspects, preeminent among which is duality. This duality takes the form of the endless opposition of contrary yet mutually interdependent and mutually complementary polarities that divide, alternately dominate, and explain the diversity, movement, and momentary arrangement of the universe. These include: being and not-being, order and disorder, life and death, light and darkness, masculine and feminine, dry and wet, hot and cold, and active and passive. Life and death, for example, are mutually arising, interdependent, and complementary aspects of one and the same process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The created cosmos consists of the unending, cyclical tug-of-war or dialectical oscillation of these polarities — all of which are the manifold manifestations of teotl. Because of this, <strong>the created cosmos is characterized as unstable, transitory, and devoid of any lasting being, order or structure</strong>. Yet teotl is nevertheless characterized by enduring pattern or regularity. How is this so? Teotl is the dynamic, sacred energy shaping as well as constituting these endless oscillations; it is the immanent balance of the endless, dialectical alternation of the created universe's interdependent polarities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because essentially processive and dynamic, teotl is properly characterized neither by being nor not-being but by becoming. Being and not-being are simply two dialectically interrelated presentations or facets of teotl, and as such inapplicable to teotl itself. Similarly, teotl is properly understood as neither ordered (law-governed) nor disordered (anarchic) but as unordered. Indeed, this point is fully general: life/death, active/passive, male/female, etc. are strictly speaking not predicable of teotl. Teotl captures a tertium quid transcending these dichotomies by being simultaneously neither-alive-nor-dead-yet-both-alive-and-dead, simultaneously neither-orderly-nor-disorderly-yet-both-orderly-and-disorderly, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, teotl is essentially an unstructured and unordered, seamless totality. Differentiation, regularity, order, etc. are simultaneously fictions of human unknowing and artistic-shamanic presentations of teotl. In Western philosophical terminology, one perhaps best characterizes the radical ontological indeterminacy of Nahua metaphysics as an extreme nominalist anti-realism, and teotl, as a Kantian-like noumenon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nahuas philosophers also conceived teotl pantheistically: (a) everything that exists constitutes an all-inclusive and interrelated unity; (b) this unity is sacred; (c) everything that exists is substantively identical and hence one with the sacred; (d) the sacred is teotl. <strong>There is only one thing, teotl, and all other forms or aspects of reality and existence are identical with teotl</strong>; (e) teotl is not a minded being or person.</p>
<p>Teotl is a sacred artist who endlessly fashions and refashions itself into and as the cosmos. The cosmos is teotl's grand, ongoing artistic-cum-metaphorical self-presentation; teotl's ongoing work of performance art or 'metaphor in motion'.</p>
<p>Teotl artistically-cum-shamanically presents and masks itself to humans in a variety of ways: (1) the apparent thingness of existents, i.e. the appearance of static entities such as humans, mountains, trees, insects, etc. <strong>This is illusory, since one and all are merely facets of teotl's sacred motion;</strong> (2) the apparent multiplicity of existents, i.e. the appearance of discrete, independently existing entities such as individual humans, plants, mountains, etc. <strong>This is illusory since there is only one thing: teotl;</strong> and (3) the apparent exclusivity, independence, and irreconcilable oppositionality of dualities such as order and disorder, life and death, etc. <strong>This is illusory since they are interrelated, complementary facets of teotl.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an epistemological consequence of teotl's self-disguising, when humans customarily gaze upon the world, what they see is teotl as a human, as a tree, as female, etc. — i.e. teotl self-disguised — rather than teotl as teotl. <strong>Wisdom enables humans to discern the sacred presence of teotl in its myriad disguises.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is humans' misperceiving and misunderstanding teotl as its disguise which prevents them from seeing teotl (reality) as it really is. The only way humans experience teotl knowingly is to experience teotl sans description (non-symbolically). Humans experience teotl knowingly via a process of mystical-style union between their hearts and teotl that enables them to experience teotl directly i.e. without mediation by language, concepts, or categories. One comes to know teotl through teotl."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words:</p>

<p>You are Teotl!</p>
<p>This is one of the most beautiful & complete articulations of nonduality that I've ever come across.</p>

<title>Philosopher's Lamp</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/philosophers-lamp</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I love this example of a <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">strange loop</a> by Belgian surrealist artist, Rene Magritte.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4088" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/rene-magritte-philosophers-lamp.jpg" alt="rene-magritte-philosophers-lamp" width="615" /></p>
<p>Here's how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> describes Magritte's style: "He became well known for creating a number of witty and thought-provoking images. Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context, his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality. Magritte's constant play with reality and illusion has been attributed to the early death of his mother."</p>
<p>René Magritte described his paintings as "visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable."</p>
<p>Just like nonduality. God is a strange loop. You try to know yourself, but you cannot.</p>

<title>Weird Life Purpose = Win!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/weird-life-purpose-equals-win</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>People sometimes think, "But Leo, how am I going to make a career out of my passion? What if my passion is something weird that cannot earn money?"</p>
<p>What people don't understand is, virtually any passion can be turned into a profitable life purpose and a career. Especially now in a globalized internet economy. Look at how this guy is following his passion:</p>

<p>That could be you — metaphorically ;)</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to be weird. Own your passion, whatever it is. You can be weird as long as you are also strategic and following the principles laid out in my Life Purpose Course.</p>

<title>Stage Green Epitome</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/stage-green-epitome</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Life doesn't get much Greener than this:</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2bs24nK5er8?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Pay close attention if watching this video triggers judgment in you. That's the Green value system rubbing up against your Orange & Blue ego.</p>
<p>How deeply have you integrated Green? How comfortable are you with Green? If this kind of value system disturbs you, you're not as developed as you like to think.</p>

<title>Conscious Capitalism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/conscious-capitalism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.consciouscapitalism.org" target="_blank">Conscious Capitalism, Inc</a> is a non-profit organization started by the founder of Whole Foods, John Mackey, whose mission is to integrate consciousness with business. They take a Spiral Dynamics stage Green/Yellow approach to business.</p>
<p>Pretty cool!</p>
<p>If you are running a stage Orange business and you do not evolve your business into Green or above in the next 50 years, your business will be crushed by Green/Yellow corporations. So stop chasing max profits and start thinking strategically about how your business fits within human society at large. Your business must serve a super-ordinate purpose beyond lining your wallet.</p>

<title>Monism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/monism</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4069" src="https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/monism_01.png" alt="monism_01" width="292" height="292" /></p>
<p>Monism is simply the idea that "strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing, the Universe, which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things" and that "only one kind of stuff exists, although many things may be made up of this stuff."</p>
<p>This "stuff" is consciousness, or "mind", out of which EVERYTHING is made. So... An atom is consciousness; a tree is consciousness; a car is consciousness; a rock is consciousness; the sun is consciousness; a mathematics equation is consciousness; a political party is consciousness; the Big Bang is consciousness; your skull is consciousness; the pixels on this screen are consciousness; and so on until every last object in the universe is accounted for. Reality is one unified field of consciousness which subdivides itself in infinite variations.</p>
<p>This is a very elegant and powerful explanation of reality. It also happens to be Absolutely True. It is so true that its truth is prior to any religion, philosophical system, scientific theory, or physical law. It is more true than 1 = 1.</p>
<p>I recommend you thoroughly read this Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism" target="_blank">Monism</a>. It's a great encapsulation of metaphysics, religion, and God across history. Monism is just another word for nonduality, and every culture around the world has a storied history of it because it turns out to be the ultimate truth. The only problem is that ultimate truth turns out to be a tricky thing for the mind to grasp, leading to much confusion and controversy.</p>

<title>The Strange Loop Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/insights/the-strange-loop-game</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>You can only appreciate this game after you understand <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/reality-is-a-strange-loop" target="_blank">what strange loops are</a>, and that YOU are a strange loop.</p>
<p></p><p class="video_box"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wC1jHHF_Wjo?rel=0&vq=hd720" width="615" height="345" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>These are the kind of games I was interested in making when I was a game designer. It took me several decades to realize that my love of game design was really just my interest in showing off the beauty of God. That's really what all art is about.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't realize how deep our motivations run until we're years into our spiritual journey. Most artists do not understand why they are artists. It's a form of pseudo-spirituality.</p>
<p>This game goes well with my other video: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/life-is-a-maze" target="_blank">Life Is A Maze</a></p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's the full quote from this week's video on <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/the-counter-intuitive-nature-of-life" target="_blank">The Counter-Intuitive Nature Of Life</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Sometimes when you win, you really lose, and sometimes when you lose, you really win, and sometimes when you win or lose, you actually tie, and sometimes when you tie, you actually win or lose. Winning or losing is all one organic mechanism, from which one extracts what one needs."</p>
